# Instructions (How to CCISS)

## SELECT SITES:

In the first tab of the CCISS tool, users can select points or areas of interest, and make manual adjustments to model parameters if necessary. For a very quick summary of functionality of this page, users can also click the *What does this page do* link at the top of the left-hand panel.

### **Step 1.** Select points or areas of interest:

Users can select points or areas of interest using **one of the following three methods**:

-   **Option 1**. Click on the biogeoclimatic (BGC) map to add one or more individual locations. Use this option if you have specific sites you are interested in or are exploring CCISS results. Where multiple sites are selected, the user can choose to generate a report where points are averaged within a BGC unit (default) or for each individual site.

-   **Option 2**. Click on the map to choose an entire BGC unit or a BGC unit within a single Forest District. The CCISS tool will use a set of pre-selected random points for the units chosen. This option is to be used where general trends are desired by area. The BGC + District option is probably most appropriate for stocking standard revisions. To find a specific BGC unit, users can use the **Find-a-BEC** drop-down menu at the bottom of the left-hand panel. This will highlight the selected unit in yellow, with a red border.

-   **Option 3**. Select a formatted CSV file to upload user-specified and named points. The batch file must be in comma-separated (.csv) text format specifying a short sitename, latitude, longitude, and (optionally) site series (formatted like ICHmc2/01a with no spaces) for each site. Batch files of up to 4000 points are supported and run at about 20 points/second.

### **Step 2. (Optional)** Select report by individual point or BGC unit average.

Users have the option of selecting to view the CCISS report either by individual points, or to average across all points in the same BGC unit. Step 1's *Option 1* and *Option 3* default to individual reports for each point, while *Option 2* defaults to a BGC unit averaged report. To change this, users can toggle the slider underneath the big blue **Generate results** button from *Report by individual sites* to *Report averaged by BGC*.

### **Step 3. (Optional)** Adjust session parameters

Users can adjust session parameters by clicking on the grey **Model parameters** button underneath the red **Clear selections** button. A dialog box appears, with options that allow users to view and adjust the default settings of the CCISS tool. Users are encouraged to read the relevant sections of the CCISS tool documentation prior to changing the default settings. A brief description is also given below.

### **Step 4**. Generate results

Click the big blue **Generate results** button on the left side of the screen to complete the analysis for the points of interest. If additional points are added or changes are made to parameters, the **Generate results** button will change to **Refresh results** to regenerate the output. <br><br>

</figure>

### 1. Climatic novelty

Climatic novelty refers to the degree of mismatch between a future climate condition and the biogeoclimatic analog it is classified as. Valid inferences of species suitability are not possible in highly novel climates. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5$\sigma$) novelty are removed from CCISS results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed suitability results. Using the **Model parameters** dialog box, users can disable the removal of novel climates and adjust the 5$\sigma$ threshold. For more information, see Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates.

### 2. Outside of Home Range (OHR) suitabilities

CCISS includes environmental suitability ratings for Douglas-fir and western larch in biogeoclimatic subzone-variants where there is strong evidence that they were suitable for the baseline 1961-1990 climate despite not occurring there naturally due to migration lag. Using the **Model parameters** dialog box, users can disable the inclusion of OHR suitabilities. See Documentation - Methods - OHR.

### 3. Establishment suitability weights

The suitability report provides an assessment of **establishment suitability**, representing the likelihood of success in establishing the species to free growing if planted in the present climate. The default setting almost equally weights the environmental suitability (expert derived) in the baseline 1961-1990 climate, and the model predicted environmental suitability from the observed 2001-2020 climate, and the projected 2021-2040 climate, with a slight weighting towards the two most recent time periods. Using the **Model parameters** dialog box, users can manually adjust these default weightings to suit their needs. See Documentation - Methods - Rule Sets.

### 4. Maturation suitability weights

The suitability report provides an assessment of **maturation suitability**: the suitability of the species through the entire future period to rotation (2021 to 2100). The default setting equally weights the four 20-year future time periods. Using the **Model parameters** dialog box, users can manually adjust these default weightings. See Documentation - Methods - Rule Sets.

### 5. Global Climate Model (GCM) weights

There are 13 GCMs available in the CCISS tool. However, the CCISS tool defaults to the 8-model ensemble of GCMs recommended by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7566" target="_blank">Mahony et al. (2022) </a> and assigns each of these models equal weighting. The other five models were excluded because their warming rates are not supported by observational evidence (CanESM5, UKESM1, INM-CM5; explained <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nrs-climate-change/climatena_8modelrationale.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, because they only have a single run for each scenario (BCC-CSM2, INM-CM5), or because they exhibit unrealistic localized warming in BC (IPSL-CM6A). Using the **Model parameters** dialog box, users can adjust which GCMs are used and their respective weightings. See Documentation - Methods - Climate Change Projections.

### 6. Scenario weights

Global climate model projections follow scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions called <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change" target="_blank">Shared Socioeconomic Pathways</a> (SSPs). The CCISS tool provides the option of giving different weights to the four major SSP scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Collectively, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 provide a reasonable representation of optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic outlooks on global emissions policies and socioeconomic development. The CCISS tool defaults to equal weighting of these three scenarios to represent scenario uncertainty in climate change projections. We have set SSP5-8.5 weighting to 0 in the default scenarios because it is extremely unlikely based on current trends in energy economics and policy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3" target="_blank">Hausfather and Peters 2020</a>). Users can adjust these weightings using the **Model parameters** dialog box. See Documentation - Methods - Climate Change Projections.

### Example: ICHdw1

In this example, the user has manually selected five points of interest in the ICHdw1 BGC unit in the Slocan Valley using Option 1 outlined in Step 1 above. Using the default model parameters and default settings for reporting, the user will obtain a separate result for each of the five selected points.

</figure>

## SUITABILITY REPORT

In this second tab, users can access the main report of the CCISS tool.
The default output is the **Detailed** report, which shows the
distribution of suitability ratings for the global climate model (GCM)
ensemble in each time period. The **Summary** provides a comparison of
the Chief Forester's Reference Guide (CFRG) species ecological
suitability and the CCISS environmental suitability projections. Users
can toggle back and forth between the **Summary** and **Detailed**
version using the slider on the left-hand side of the screen, under
*Report Type* (more detail below).

The concept and definitions of environmental suitability ratings and
their relationship to stocking standards (according to the CFRG) and
CCISS model projections are discussed in more detail in the Suitability
Ratings section of the Methods documentation.

### Selection/Filter pane

In the left pane, users can select the point or BGC subzone-variant and
then the site series of interest. The edatopic space of the selected
site series is displayed in the graphic below for reference (see example
in Figure 1 and 2 below). By default the report will show all species
that are predicted to be suitable in at least one model and time period.
Users have the option to choose the *Suitable Only* option to limit the
list to species that meet the threshold for classification as suitable
across the GCM ensemble in any of the time periods. Users can also opt
to include outside home range (OHR) species here. For more information
on OHR species, visit Documentation - Methods - Outside Home Range.

### Detailed report

The **Detailed** report shows modelled suitability ratios for each
species in the selected site series for each time period. The colour
legend for suitability ratings is on the left hand pane. The mapped BGC
unit represents the historic climate approximated by the climatic
conditions of the 1961-1990 period. The recent time period (2001-2020)
has two bars: one for the observed climate (measured by weather
stations), and one for the climates simulated by the ensemble of GCMs.
These two bars are not necessarily expected to agree: the modelled
climates sample a large range of possible recent conditions, of which
the observed recent climate is only one.

The report then summarizes the historical suitability ratings and CCISS
projected suitability ratings for each species in the following order:

1.  The **CFRG suitability** rating: Ecological suitability ratings for
    a timber objective taken from the Chief Forester's Reference Guide
    for Stocking Standards (CFRG)

2.  The **CFRG P/A** value: Preferred/Acceptable ratings taken directly
    from the CFRG

3.  The **Historical Environmental Suitability**: Expert derived
    baseline (1961-1990) environmental suitability rating for site
    series.

4.  **CCISS Establishment Suitability**: The weighted average
    suitability rating based on the historical environmental suitability
    (1961-1990), and CCISS projected suitability based on recent
    observed (2001-2020), and 2021-2040 future projected climates. This
    indicates the likely level of constraints for successful
    establishment of the species in the present climate. Default model
    settings give roughly equal weight to the three time periods, with
    slightly more weight to the recent (2001+) periods.

5.  **CCISS Maturation Suitability**: The weighted average suitability
    rating projected across the four 20-year normal periods (2021-2100).
    This indicates the inferred suitability of successfully growing an
    established species to maturity (80 years). Default model settings
    equally weight all time periods.

6.  **Trend**: The proportion of the GCM simulations indicating
    improving/stable suitability (numerator) vs. declining suitability
    or remaining unsuitable.

*Reminder:* The weights used to calculate Establishment Suitability and
Maturation Suitability can be modified using the "Adjust Parameters"
dialog box in the "Select Sites" tab.

#### Novel climates

Climatic novelty refers to the difference between future climate
condition and the climate condition of the closest biogeoclimatic
analog. Where future climates are highly novel, i.e. there is
substantial difference between the future climate condition and the
closest analog, there is much higher uncertainty around species
suitability projections. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with
high (5$\sigma$) novelty are removed from CCISS results and replaced
with a black bar in the detailed suitability results. Removal of novel
climates can be disabled or adjusted using the "Adjust Parameters"
dialog box in the "Select Sites" tab. If novel climates are not removed,
the CCISS tool makes the assumption that all future analogs are equal,
despite the novel climates potentially not being good analogs. See
Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more details.

### Summary report

This report compares CCISS projected suitability at maturity with the
Chief Forester's Reference Guide ecological suitability. Species codes
are coloured according to trends in their future suitability using the
legend at the bottom of the selection pane: improving (green), or
decreasing (red). Species added to the CCISS projected stocking
standard\* are coloured purple, and species dropped from the CCISS
projected stocking standard *are strike-through.*

\*Note: These are not formally adopted stocking standards by BC Ministry
of Forests.

### Example: ICHdw1 cont.

The following example continues using the five points selected
previously in the *SELECT SITES* Instructions panel of the CCISS tool.
Figure 1 shows the top few lines of the **Detailed** report, when the
default *Remove highly novel climates* is selected through the dialog
box accessed via the **Model Parameters** button, while Figure 2 shows
how this report changes when *No Novelty Analysis* is selected instead.

<figure style="text-align:center;">

<img src="Figure_Instructions_Suitability_Novel.png" style="width:55%;"/>

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 1: Example of a **Detailed** suitability report for the 101 -
CwFd-Prince's pine - Twinflower site series of the ICHdw1 biogeoclimatic
subzone-variant in the Slocan Valley, with the option *Remove highly
novel climates* selected in dialog box accessed through the **Model
parameters** button.

</figcaption>

</figure>

The **Detailed** report (Figure 1) is displaying the results for the 1st
point (1 / 6530760). The seven-digit number here simply refers to the
hex cell that the point is located in. In this example, we have selected
the ICHdw1/101 CwFd - Prince's pine - Twinflower site series. We can see
from the bars under *Modelled Suitability* that for **Fd**
(Douglas-fir), the mapped (historic: 1961-1990) suitability was E1: High
(Documentation - Methods - Suitability Ratings). Accordingly, the CFRG
rates Fd **1** for *Primary* and **P** for *Preferred* at this site. The
CCISS tool projections resulted in an E1 rating at *Establishment*, and
an E2 (moderate) at *Maturity*. The modelled suitability ratios *Trend*
shows that 87 percent of model "votes" suggested that the suitability of
**Fd** would either improve or stay the same, and 13 percent suggested a
decline in suitability.

If we return to the bar chart, under the "Mapped" bar, we see the two
bars that represent the recent time period (2001-2020). From this, we
can see that the weather station data (obs) and the climates simulated
by the ensemble of GCMs (mod) are in agreement that Fd has been a highly
suitable (E1) species at this location.

The CCISS tool then allows us to evaluate the future projected
environmental suitability of the tree species. We see that in the first
of the future periods (2021-2040), there is not much change in the
suitability of **Fd**. However, in the next three future periods
(2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100), we can see the introduction of
novel climates. These are climates for which there is no good
analog in the pool of Western North America historical climates. See
Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more information. Since the
climate in this region is projected to be distinct from other BGC
analogs in Western North America, we do not know how well Douglas-fir
will fare in these conditions, which means there is increased
uncertainty around future suitability. Overall, the CCISS tool suggests
that **Fd** will remain suitable to future climate at this location, with
some caution around unknown suitability under novel future climate.

The next species on the list is **Lw** (western larch). The outlook for
this species is more unfavourable than for **Fd**. As can be seen by the
green E1 bar for "Mapped", **Lw** was highly suitable under historical
environmental conditions in this BGC unit, and rated primary (1) by the
CFRG. However, the two bars for the recent period (2001-2020)
demonstrate decreasing suitability to E2. CCISS projections suggest that
as early as the current (2021-2040) time period, this suitability will
drop to an E3. By the end of the century, only 17% of models suggest an
E3 rating for this species, with 31% predicting unsuitable, and the rest
falling into a novel climate where we do not know how **Lw** will
respond. This information suggests that **Lw** is a highly risky species
to plant in the ICHdw1/101.

<figure style="text-align:center;">

<img src="Figure_Instructions_Suitability_NoNovel.png" style="width:55%;"/>

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 2: Example of a **Detailed** suitability report for the 101 -
CwFd-Prince's pine - Twinflower site series of the ICHdw1 biogeoclimatic
subzone-variant in the Slocan Valley, with the option *No Novelty
Analysis* selected in dialog box accessed through the **Model
parameters** button.

</figcaption>

</figure>

In Figure 2, we see the impact that selecting "No Novelty Analysis" has
on our results. In this scenario, the CCISS tool does not remove highly
novel predictions, instead displaying all BGC projections including
those that may not be good analogs. As a result, the CCISS gives us a
more confident answer about the suitability of **Fd**, suggesting that
its suitability until 2100 will remain fairly stable. In this example,
the projected BGCs associated with novel climate contain an **Fd**
species suitability rating of E1. Therefore, it promotes the Maturity
Suitability to an E1, whereas in Figure 1, we see that it was demoted to
an E2 due to the greater proportion of unsuitable (X) ratings in
relation to suitable (E1) ratings. In Figure 2, the modelled suitability
ratios show that 92 percent of model "votes" suggested that the
suitability of Fd would either improve or stay the same, and 8 percent
suggested a decline in suitability. Removing highly novel predictions
represents a more conservative or cautious approach.

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

which shows the difference between the CCISS projected environmental
suitabilities and the original ecological suitability proposed by the
Chief Forester's Reference Guide.

</figcaption>

</figure>

Finally, we see an example of a **Summary** report (Figure 3). This
feature allows the user to explicitly compare CCISS results with those
of the CFRG. The species shown in [red]{style="color:red"} text are
decreasing in suitability. Those that are crossed out have, on average,
across all time periods, GCMs, and SSPs, decreased so much that they are
now predicted to be unsuitable. Species marked in
[green]{style="color:darkgreen"} are improving in suitability, but none
of those exist in the current example. Finally, if the user was to
switch to *No Novelty Analysis* in the **Select Sites** tab, under
**Model Parameters**, they would see some species show up here in
[purple]{style="color:purple"} (Adding). Purple species are those that
were not included in the CFRG because they were historically unsuitable
here, but CCISS predicts future climates in which they could be
suitable.

In this case, we see that only two species remain suitable according to
the CCISS projections **Fd** (E2) and **Py** (E3). **Py** (Ponderosa
pine) is another interesting example, because the displayed projections
(i.e. not novel climate) predict a divergence in suitability (E1, E3 and
unsuitable), tending towards an increase in suitability over time and
averaging to an E3 rating (Figure 4). This species has 80 percent of
model "votes" suggesting increasing/maintained suitability, and only 20
percent suggest a decrease. However, much of the future climate is novel
and there is a high degree of uncertainty around the future suitability
of Py.

Note on footnotes: **Py** has footnote 9 in the CFRG, which corresponds
to *most suitable on warm aspects*. This is where applying expert
knowledge to CCISS results is key, because under warmer future climate,
it might actually be more suitable on cooler aspects instead.

## BEC FUTURES:

This section summarizes the biogeoclimatic (BGC) projections that
underlie the species suitability forecasts. Biogeoclimatic
subzone/variants (a.k.a. BGC units) are the climate component of the
Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC). Each user-selected
location has a mapped BGC unit representing its historical climate.
Biogeoclimatic projections identify a BGC unit whose historical climate
is the best match (best analog) for the future climate at a
user-selected location. In other words, changes in climatic conditions
(temperature, precipitation, etc) are translated into a change in the
BGC unit.

### Chart

Users can view the chart mode, which displays a stacked bar chart
showing the ratio of future BGC analogs by time period predicted across
a range of global climate model-scenario climate projections. Hovering
over a stacked bar will display these proportions numerically.

The recent time period (2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed
climate (measured by weather stations and interpolated across the
province), and one for the modelled climates (simulated by global
climate models). These two aren't expected to agree: the modelled
climates sample a large range of possible recent conditions, of which
the observed recent climate is only one.

The default mode of this plot simply shows the BGC analog labels. Users
can specify a site series of interest and select "Site Series Overlap"
on the lefthand pane, which will display the site series in the BGC
analog that overlap with the edatopic position of the historic site
series, along with the proportion of the edatopic overlap. The "minimum
site series overlap" slider allows the user to include or exclude site
series with small edatopic overlaps.

### Map

After switching to the **Map** tab in the drop-down menu under **BEC
Futures**, users can select the site or area of interest from the drop
down menu and then select a future time period. The map will highlight
the historical BGC unit in colour (pink) and the projected BGC analogs
in grey. Darker greys indicate a higher proportion of global climate
model projections matched that BGC analog.

### Example: ICHdw1 cont.

Continuing on with the example of the ICHdw1 - Interior Cedar-Hemlock -
West Kootenay Dry Warm, in the Slocan Valley, we can see the projected
BGC units that inform changes to species suitability (See Suitability
Report tab), displayed as stacked bar charts by selecting **Charts**.

Note: See Documentation - Definitions - BEC Codes for the biogeoclimatic
zone and subzone names.

<figure style="text-align:center;">

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 1: Stacked bar chart showing the mapped (historic) BGC unit, the
BGC unit(s) associated with observed/modelled (2001-2020) climate, as
well as the ratio of future BGC climate analogs predicted by CCISS. This
version of the chart was created with the default setting for climate
novelty in the **Select Sites** tab (*Remove highly novel climates*).

</figcaption>

</figure>

We can see that the future climate of the ICHdw1 in the Slocan Valley is
predicted to much more closely resemble climates historically found in
Washington, Oregon, and California. In the recent period's modelled
results, most 'votes' agree with the observed weather data that the
climate most closely resembled that of ICHxw (Interior Cedar-Hemlock
very dry warm) between 2001 and 2020. In the 2021-2040 time period, the
IDFww (Interior Douglas-fir wet warm) becomes the dominant climate
analog, and novel climates begin to appear. By the 2081-2100 period, the
CMXxm_CA (Coastal Mixed Evergreen very dry mild California) becomes the
BGC unit with the most votes. The historical analog for this climate is
found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California
(Figure 3), and it is much warmer than the historical climate in the
Kootenays.

version of the chart was created by changing the setting for climate
novelty in the **Select Sites** tab to *No Novelty Analysis*.

</figcaption>

</figure>

When we ignore climate novelty and consider all analogs as equal, we see
quite a different future, with a dominance of the CWFdm_OR (Coastal
White Fir dry mild Oregon) in the 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100
periods.

## SILVICS

This section contains information that may be useful for interpreting CCISS results and making management decisions. More information can be found in the **About** tab of this section. 

This module summarizes the silvics of each species with historic or future suitability in the selected BGC unit and site series. This information is drawn from Klinka et al. (2000). This information can be explored further at this <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/tree-species-selection/tool-introduction/tree-species-silvics-and-comparisons" target="_blank">link</a>.

### Example: ICHdw1 cont.

Here's what the output from the **Silvics** tab would look like given the example in the ICHdw1. The user can select the site series within the BGC subzone/variant, and select whether they want to see the Klinka et al. (2000) information for just suitable species, or for all species.

## EXPORT

### Export Report

The report is designed for documentation and off-line use of a CCISS tool report session, for example, as an appendix to a site plan. We recommend including only the site series of interest to the user. Choose the "Suitable Only" option to limit the list to species that meet the threshold for inclusion as suitable in any of the time periods.

### Export data

Suitability data can be exported for conducting further analyses such as calculating summary statistics for your area of interest. Suitability data exported from the CCISS tool is in "long form" with each row showing projected suitability by site of interest, site series, and tree species. Data are exported as a .CSV file; a PDF metadata report is included in the export folder.

### Example: ICHdw1 cont.

Continuing with our example in the ICHdw1, here's what the **Export** page would look like.

## CCISS SPATIAL

The spatial module of the CCISS tool allows users to put CCISS results
into spatial context and explore CCISS data inputs (i.e. BGC model and
species environmental suitability ratings).

Functionality of the CCISS spatial module includes:

-   Maps of biogeoclimatic projections for the GCM ensemble and for five
    representative GCM simulations;
-   Maps of tree species environmental suitability projections for three
    site types (i.e., edatopes);
-   Overlays of climatic novelty for each biogeoclimatic or suitability
    projection;
-   Pop-up interactive plots on user-selected locations ;
-   Interactive plots of biogeoclimatic and suitability changes within
    user-selected subregions;
-   Downloads of spatial data for active map layer at 200m raster
    resolution; and
-   Find-A-BEC for locating specified biogeoclimatic units of Western
    North America.

### Subregion type

The options for Subregion type are `None`, `District` - BC Natural
Resource Districts, and `FLP Area` - Forest Landscape Planning (FLP)
areas. We currently provide functionality for 10 FLP areas; we will add
more as they become publicly available. When a subregion is clicked on
the map, an interactive plot appears to the right of the map. The plot
shows ensemble mean change in biogeoclimatic unit area or species
suitability; variation by GCM can be viewed by clicking the lines on the
map.

### Display BGC or Suitability

Select whether the map displays biogeoclimatic (BGC) units or species
suitability. Subsequent dialogue boxes are customized for each of these
two modes, as described below.

### BGC mode

Select reference period (baseline) historical climate, observed recent
climate (2001-2020), or future climates.

-   When `Reference (1961-1990)` is selected, there is the option of
    selecting between `Mapped or Predicted` view. The `Mapped` BGC units
    are a rasterization of the official linework of BEC version 13.
    `Modelled` represents the BGC unit predicted by the biogeoclimatic
    model used to generate the CCISS projections. The model is trained
    with a sample of locations from each biogeoclimatic unit, and is not
    expected to perfectly reproduce the official linework.

-   When `Observed (2001-2020)` is selected, this displays the BGC units
    selected by the BGC model associated with the observed (recorded)
    climate of 2001-2020. This time period already reflects a slight
    shift in the climate associated with each BGC relative to the
    1961-1990 reference period and therefore the BGC climate analog
    selected by the model.

-   When `Future (GCMs)` is selected, `Select GCM` controls whether the
    map shows ensemble results or individual GCM simulations.
    `SZ_Ensemble` displays the *biogeoclimatic subzone/variant* with the
    highest number of votes across the ensemble of 60 simulations (i.e.,
    the ensemble vote winner); `Zone_Ensemble` shows the *biogeoclimatic
    zone* with the most votes. These may be different because votes for
    the highest-voted subzone variant may be outnumbered by votes for
    multiple subzone/variants from another biogeoclimatic zone. To see
    what the breakdown of votes was for any given location, users can
    click on the map, and a pop-up will appear with stacked bars showing
    the percent of votes for each BGC unit in each time period. For more
    information, see the example at the bottom of this page.
    `Select period` allows the user to select a time period between 2001
    and 2100, split in 20-year increments. Here 2001-2020 represents the
    modeled results of the GCM simulations for that time period (not
    observed climate records).

Regional summaries can be viewed by selecting `District` or `FLP Area`
from the left-hand panel, and clicking on the area of interest on the
map. A box will appear on the right-hand panel of the screen, where
users can adjust the x-variable of interest (time, MAT - Mean Annual
Temperature, MAP - Mean Annual Precipitation, CMD - Climatic Moisture
Deficit , or DD5 - Growing Degree Days above 5°C). Users can also select
whether they want to summarize by zone (or by subzone-variant if
un-checked), and if they want to show the 2001-2020 observed period as
points on the resulting plot.

### Suitability mode

Throughout Suitability mode, there is the option of choosing a
representative edatope (site type) and tree species.

-   `Select Edatope (SNR/SMR)` represents a Soil Nutrient Regime/Soil
    Moisture Regime combination. The dropdown provides the option of B2
    (nutrient-poor, subxeric), C4 (nutrient-medium, mesic), or D6
    (nutrient-rich, hygric). Displaying all 35 edatopes is
    computationally infeasible, so we chose these three edatopes to
    represent distinct, common site types.\
-   `Select species` allows for selection among 15 common native BC tree
    species. Additional species will be added in the future. Codes for
    each species are defined in
    Documentation\>Definitions\>SpeciesCodes.

The mapping of suitability for each time period selected reflects the
underlying BGC unit(s) mapped or projected.

When `Reference (1961-1990)` is selected, this displayed the expert
assigned suitability rating for site series that overlap the selected
edatope. When `Mapped` is selected the mapping of BGC units reflects the
BEC version 13 linework. When `Modelled` is selected the mapping
reflects the BGC units predicted by the biogeoclimatic model used to
generate the CCISS projections. The methods for assigning and
definitions of these ratings are defined in
Documentation\>Methods\>SuitabilityRatings.

When `Observed (2001-2020)` or `Future (GCMs)` is selected, there is the
option of mapping `Projected Suitability` or `Suitability Change`.

-   `Projected Suitability` displays the CCISS environmental suitability
    rating for the selected time period associated with the projected
    BGC units.
-   `Suitability Change` displays the change in suitability relative to
    the mapped reference period (1961-1990) suitability rating,
    increasing (blue), decreasing (red) or no change (grey). Species
    that are projected to become "newly suitable" in areas where they
    were historically unsuitable are mapped in yellow to differentiate
    this suitability range expansion from increases in suitability
    within the historically suitable range of the species (represented
    in blue).

#### Suitability pop-up plot

When a location on the suitability map is clicked, a pop-up is activated
providing interactive 2D plots of the change in biogeoclimatic analogs
and species suitability over time at that location. There may be more
than one suitability rating for individual biogeoclimatic units because
in some cases the selected edatope is shared by two site series with
different suitability ratings (see Documentation\>Methods\>Edatopic
Overlap).

### Display Novelty

In BGC or Suitability mode, the `Display Novelty?` checkbox overlays a
map of estimated climatic novelty. High climatic novelty (\>5σ, red
colors) indicates that the biogeoclimatic subzone/variant identified by
the biogeoclimatic model is a very poor analog for the future climate
condition, even though it is the best (i.e. closest in climatic space)
available. The CCISS tool uses a default dissimilarity threshold of
5-sigma (5σ) to infer a novel climate and exclude the biogeoclimatic
analog. Novelty in the 3-5σ range can be interpreted as a poor analog.
In this range, species suitability inferences may be useful but are also
likely to be somewhat misleading. The methods and interpretation of
climatic novelty are explained in Documentation\>Methods\>Novel
Climates.

#### Novelty pop-up plot

When a location on the novelty map is clicked, a pop-up is activated
providing an interactive 3D plot comparing future climates to the
historical climate of the analog. Click and drag to spin the plot. This
plot is the same for all locations that have the same biogeoclimatic
analog for the selected GCM and time period. Blue dots are the spatial
variation in baseline (1961-1990) climates of the analog. Black dots are
the 1951-1990 interannual climatic variability (ICV) of the BGC analog.
Filled circles (grey-yellow-red) are projected climates of locations in
British Columbia that are assigned the analog by the BGC model, with
colours indicating sigma novelty consistent with the map legend. The
cross symbol represents the 'selected location', the average climate of
the projected future/observed time period selected for the location that
has been clicked (i.e. individual raster cell). The axes of the plot are
principal components (PCs) of analog variation, with PC1 being the axis
with the most variation in the plotted points, and PC3 having the least.
Labelled lines indicate correlations of the input variables with the 3
PCs that comprise the viewspace.

### Hide/Show Layer

This button removes the CCISS layer to reveal the basemap. This is
useful for comparing the CCISS maps to the topography, satellite photo,
or baseline BGC linework. These basemaps can be selected in the top
right-hand corner of the map:

### Find-A-BEC

The `Find-A-BEC` feature helps with locating specified biogeoclimatic
units of Western North America. Select the BGC zone of interest and then
use `Deselect All` to select a subset of subzone/variants within that
zone. Applying the `Gray non-selected BGCs` checkbox assists with
finding the selected unit(s).

### Export data from **CCISS Spatial**:

Data from **CCISS Spatial** are downloadable as raster files. Users can
opt to download data for the whole province by clicking on the gray
**Download Province** button at the bottom of the left-hand panel, or
they can select a specific district or FLP area in the same panel. If
they select a district or FLP area of interest, a pop up appears on the
right-hand side (also where users can view the regional summaries).
Here, users can download the raster file of the map they are currently
viewing.

### Example: ICHdw1 cont.

Throughout the **Instructions**, we have been following an example of
the ICHdw1 in the Slocan Valley of BC. Here, here we see the projected
BGC analogs for this area. In Figure 3, we have selected to display
BGCs, and are opting to look at the future. We selected the
`SZ_Ensemble`, which represents the ensemble vote winner (i.e., BGC
analog with the most votes) in the 2061-2080 time period. When we hover
over the area represented by the black dot, we can see the Layer Info
box that reads **Predicted BGC: CWFdm_OR**. When we click on this spot,
the BGC Projections pop-up appears, which gives a breakdown of the
different BGC units (i.e., subzone/variants) that were predicted by each
of the model runs. We can see that indeed, in the 2061-2080 period, the
CWFdm_OR - Coastal White Fir dry maritime Oregon - has the most votes,
and that it received roughly 50% of votes for that period.

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 3: BGC projections - SZ_Ensemble, which displays the
*biogeoclimatic subzone/variant* with the highest number of votes across
simulations. At the point of interest (black dot) added here, the ensemble vote 
winner (i.e., BGC unit with the most "votes", is CWFdm_OR).

</figcaption>

</figure>

Next, in Figure 4, we have selected `Zone_Ensemble` from the **Select
GCM** dropdown menu. We can now see the predicted biogeoclimatic zone
rather than subzone/variant. This zone is selected by adding up the
votes for each zone. We can see that it is the CWF - Coastal White Fir -
that has the most votes in the 2061-2080 time period.

*biogeoclimatic zone* with the highest number of votes across simulations. At the point of interest (black

</figure>

We can also look at tree species suitability over time, in three
different edatopes. In Figure 5, we remain centered on the Slocan Valley
of British Columbia. In this example, we have now selected to display
`Suitability` rather than `BGC`. We selected the C4 edatope, and **Fd**
(Douglas-fir). For a list of species codes, see
Documentation\>Definitions\>Species Codes.

In this map, we are looking at projected suitabilities for the 2061-2080
time period. The [green]{style="color:darkgreen"} text represents areas
with E1, or high suitability, while [blue]{style="color:blue"}
demonstrates areas with E2, or moderate suitability. The
[yellow]{style="color:yellow"} areas have low suitability, and white
areas are unsuitable for **Fd**.

<figure style="text-align:center;">

<img src="Figure_Instructions_CCISSspatial_suitabilities.png" style="width:55%;"/>

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 5: Still centered around the Slocan Valley, this map shows
projected future suitabilities for Fd (Douglas-fir) in the 2061-2080
future period. Green is E1: High, blue is E2: Moderate, yellow is E3:
Low suitability, and white is unsuitable.

</figcaption>

</figure>

We can also look at suitability in a different way. Rather than viewing
the suitability for a species in each time period separately, we can opt
to look at the *change* in suitability over time (selecting
`Suitability Change`). In this map, we see that the suitability ratings
for **Fd** in the C4 edatope in the Slocan Valley are expected to
decrease by the 2061-2080s. These areas of decrease are marked with a
gradient of shades of [red]{style="color:red"}. Meanwhile, higher
elevation areas upward from the valley are projected to increase in
suitability. Areas where suitability is expected to increase are shown
in [blue]{style="color:blue"}. Finally, areas that are becoming newly
suitable are shown in shades of [yellow]{style="color:yellow"}.

historic period (1961-1990) in the Slocan Valley area.

</figure>

In this area, the CCISS tool predicts a lot of novel climates (i.e.,
climates with no good historical analogs). We can see that by clicking
on the `Display Novelty?` checkbox at the bottom of the left-hand panel.
This means that there is much uncertainty about how species will respond
to changes in climate here, because there are no historical areas within
Western North America that have experienced these exact climate
conditions.
