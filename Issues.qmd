# Known Issues

## Known issues with the CCISS tool :(

This section is focused on aspects of the CCISS analysis related to
trade-offs and intrinsic sources of error. We also list bugs or minor
enhancements that have not yet been resolved. If you have an problem or
suggestion to report, you can enter it as a "New issue" in our
<a href="https://github.com/bcgov/CCISS_ShinyApp/issues" target="_blank">GitHub
repo </a>.

### Issues requiring fixing

-   The CCISS tool should only take about 10 seconds to load at startup.
    However, it has recently been taking up to 50 seconds. We are
    investigating this issue.

-   The CCISS tool is currently missing CFRG species suitability ratings
    ("Suitability" tab) and silvics information ("Silvics" tab) for
    coastal subzone/variants, this is associated with updating to the
    new coastal BEC version (BEC13). We will update this information
    using a crosswalk table from BEC v12 coastal site series (LMH 26 and
    28) to BEC v13 (LHM77) asap.

-   OHR (Outside Home Range) species suitability ratings for white pine
    (Pw) have been added in the Skeena Region. However, the CCISS tool
    does not include the full extent of white pine suitability outside
    of home range. Additional modeling and expert knowledge is needed to
    complete the distribution of white pine OHR suitability. This work
    is ongoing and will be documented and integrated into the CCISS
    tool. See "Methods" - "Outside Home Range" for more information.

-   There are known issues related to the classification and mapping of
    northern BGC units. This includes unclassified units, labeled "un",
    for example SWBun or ESSFun. Additionally, some current BGC units
    may need to be split in the future. For example, the SBSwk1 has been
    mapped differently in the Omineca vs. Cariboo Regions. Douglas-fir
    is very rare in the Cariboo SBSwk1 but more common in the Omineca.
    SBSwk1 mapping will likely need substantial revisions in the
    Omineca.


## Sources of error in data and analyses

Understanding potential sources of error is essential for appropriate
use of the CCISS tool. The CCISS methodology has many components such as the species suitability ratings, climate mapping, biogeoclimatic
modeling, biogeoclimatic classification, and climate data downscaling.
Each of these components have their own degree of error that can carry
through into the CCISS tool results, emphasizing the importance of
professional scrutiny in the interpretation of these results.

While often used interchangeably,
error and uncertainty are different processes. Error is the absolute
difference between an estimated value and the ‘true’ value for a
quantity of interest that, in most cases, is unknown. Thus, unlike
uncertainty, error cannot be directly quantified. However, understanding
potential sources of error can help users determine appropriate uses for
CCISS projections.

### Suitability ratings

Tree species' environmental tolerances are complex and many
approximations are required to translate them into a simple suitability
ratings metric used in CCISS. Suitability ratings for each tree species
in each site series have been assigned primarily through expert
judgement with support from vegetation plot data. There are inevitably
errors in this database, particularly for species that were not
historically prominent in reforestation, such as deciduous species. The
suitability ratings are undergoing ongoing review by the CCISS team and
regional ecologists. Further, the CCISS team is currently conducting
predictive modeling to quantitatively evaluate and refine suitability
ratings. For more information see Methods \> Expert Review

### Climate mapping

The reference climate maps for CCISS are the PRISM (Parameter-elevation
Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) climate surfaces of temperature
and precipitation at 800m spatial resolution developed by the <a href="https://www.pacificclimate.org/data/prism-climatology-and-monthly-timeseries" target="_blank">Pacific
Climate Impacts Consortium</a>.
These surfaces are best-in-class, but they have important limitations.
They are interpolated from weather station data that is sparse in many
regions of BC (Figure 2). Most valleys and some larger regions have no
stations, so the nuances of climate in these locations may not be well
represented, particularly cold air drainage and elevational gradients.
Further, the PRISM method does not model microclimatic factors such as
heat loading (warm vs. cold aspects), vegetation influences, and lake
effects. Microclimatic factors need to be accounted for during
professional interpretation of CCISS results.

### Biogeoclimatic (BGC) modeling

Biogeoclimatic modeling involves using machine learning to classify
climate conditions as biogeoclimatic units (subzones/variants). We have
found that BGC projections are sensitive to many aspects of model
training, especially climate variable selection. The current version of
the BGC projections is a work in progress, and future refinements will
be made. As more end users engage with the CCISS tool, additional issues
may come to light.

We have already identified several areas for improvement. One key issue
is that the baseline maps are not being perfectly reconstructed,
resulting in fuzzy boundaries, and the over- and underrepresentation of
certain BGC units. For example, the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine
(CMA) zone in the Pemberton region appears to be consistently
underrepresented.

Additionally, future projections appear highly sensitive to changes in
sampling scheme, climate variable sets, and Random Forest model hyperparameters.
These factors will be closely examined in future iterations to improve
the model’s predictive ability. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/biogeoclimatic-projections" target="_blank">Biogeoclimatic
Projections</a> technical report.

### Climate data downscaling

Climate changes are modeled in CCISS by overlaying very coarse-scale
global climate model projections (50-150km resolution; Figure 3) onto
the 800m PRISM climate maps, a method called <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/climr/articles/methods_downscaling.html" target="_blank">change-factor downscaling</a>.
This approach results in a uniform warming rate from valley bottom to
mountain top. In reality, we would expect elevation-dependent
differences in warming rate due to loss of snowpack, for example.
Similarly, change-factor downscaling can’t represent the role of other
fine-scale features like lakes, vegetation, cold-air pooling, aspect,
and soil moisture in modifying the regional average climate change. The
Ministry of Forests' ClimatEx project seeks to improve the spatial
resolution of climate change modeling, but will not be integrated into
CCISS for at least two years. CCISS users are encouraged to consider the
role of site-specific modification of regional climate changes.

## BGC mapping as a baseline

CCISS results assess change in species suitability relative to the official biogeoclimatic mapping, rather than the baseline prediction of the biogeoclimatic model. This approach breaks a standard practice of climate impacts modeling: change in a modeled quantity should be assessed against a modeled baseline. We have taken this approach to simplify interpretation of CCISS results. Our rationale is explained below. 

Biogeoclimatic models are trained on biogeoclimatic mapping (the response variable) and 1961-1990 climate normals (the predictor variables) for a sample of locations. When the model is then used to predict the biogeoclimatic unit from 1961-1990 climate normals, this is called a *baseline prediction*. Baseline predictions do not perfectly reproduce the original biogeoclimatic mapping because of imperfections in the biogeoclimatic model, biogeoclimatic mapping, and climate mapping. Biogeoclimatic models typically have baseline prediction error of ~20%, meaning that the baseline biogeoclimatic prediction is different than the official biogeoclimatic subzone/variant mapping on about 20% of the landscape. In many cases where these differences occur, the predicted unit is closely related to the mapped unit and there is negligible consequence for tree species suitability inferences. 

Baseline predictions are the technically correct point of comparison for biogeoclimatic projections of recent or future climates. If the mapped biogeoclimatic unit is used as a baseline, there is the potential to confuse model error with an actual change in climate. This conflation of model error with real changes causes overestimation of biogeoclimatic turn-over, but it can produce underestimation or overestimation of changes in species suitability. The impact of this conflation will be greatest in the recent period (2001-2020) since the magnitude of prediction error relative to climate change decreases over time. 

Even though a modeled baseline prediction is strictly more correct, we have chosen to use the official biogeoclimatic mapping as the baseline for CCISS results. The benefit of this approach is that the starting point for users will be the expected biogeoclimatic unit and species suitability ratings of their locations of interest. The alternative--using the modeled baseline prediction--would in some cases produce a baseline biogeoclimatic unit that is different than the biogeoclimatic unit of interest. This would not be tenable for core CCISS end uses such as silviculture prescriptions and stocking standards development. 

Given that the mapped and predicted baseline biogeoclimatic unit are different on <20% of most landscapes, and that these differences are inconsequential for species suitability interpretations in many cases, the practical impact of this approach is likely not large. Nevertheless, we have not yet assessed this issue quantitatively. Users are encouraged to use the CCISS spatial module to assess baseline prediction errors for locations of critical interest and to consider the implications for species suitability interpretations. 

## Space-for-time substitution

The CCISS analysis is a space-for-time substitution: it uses observations of tree species' tolerances across spatial gradients in climate to infer each species' response to future climate changes. In other words, to understand tree species suitability in a hotter future at any location, we study tree species suitability in warmer places (climate analogs downhill and to the south). The space-for-time substitution approach is useful and necessary; the alternative would be physiological modeling of each tree species, a process with its own assumptions, sources of error, and data limitations. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the space-for-time substitution approach. This approach assumes that spatial differences in environmental conditions mirror the temporal changes expected under climate change, with the added assumption that tree responses to these conditions are consistent across both space and time. The errors associated with violations of these assumptions will vary depending on the species, site, region and silvicultural system.
