    "text": "3.1.1 Step 1. Select points or areas of interest:\nUsers can select points or areas of interest using one of the following three methods:\n\nOption 1. Click on the biogeoclimatic (BGC) map to add one or more individual locations. Use this option if you have specific sites you are interested in or are exploring CCISS results. Where multiple sites are selected, the user can choose to generate a report where points are averaged within a BGC unit (default) or for each individual site.\nOption 2. Click on the map to choose an entire BGC unit or a BGC unit within a single Forest District. The CCISS tool will use a set of pre-selected random points for the units chosen. This option is to be used where general trends are desired by area. The BGC + District option is probably most appropriate for stocking standard revisions. To find a specific BGC unit, users can use the Find-a-BEC drop-down menu at the bottom of the left-hand panel. This will highlight the selected unit in yellow, with a red border.\nOption 3. Select a formatted CSV file to upload user-specified and named points. The batch file must be in comma-separated (.csv) text format specifying a short sitename, latitude, longitude, and (optionally) site series (formatted like ICHmc2/01a with no spaces) for each site. Batch files of up to 4000 points are supported and run at about 20 points/second.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Step 2. (Optional) Select report by individual point or BGC unit average.\nUsers have the option of selecting to view the CCISS report either by individual points, or to average across all points in the same BGC unit. Step 1’s Option 1 and Option 3 default to individual reports for each point, while Option 2 defaults to a BGC unit averaged report. To change this, users can toggle the slider underneath the big blue Generate results button from Report by individual sites to Report averaged by BGC.\n\n\n3.1.3 Step 3. (Optional) Adjust session parameters\nUsers can adjust session parameters by clicking on the grey Model parameters button underneath the red Clear selections button. A dialog box appears, with options that allow users to view and adjust the default settings of the CCISS tool. Users are encouraged to read the relevant sections of the CCISS tool documentation prior to changing the default settings. A brief description is also given below.\n\n\n3.1.4 Step 4. Generate results\nClick the big blue Generate results button on the left side of the screen to complete the analysis for the points of interest. If additional points are added or changes are made to parameters, the Generate results button will change to Refresh results to regenerate the output.",

    "text": "3.2 More information on adjusting session parameters:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of the dialog box for adjusting Model parameters. Steps 1-6 correspond with the documentation below the figure.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 1. Climatic novelty\nClimatic novelty refers to the degree of mismatch between a future climate condition and the biogeoclimatic analog it is classified as. Valid inferences of species suitability are not possible in highly novel climates. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5\\(\\sigma\\)) novelty are removed from CCISS results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed suitability results. Using the Model parameters dialog box, users can disable the removal of novel climates and adjust the 5\\(\\sigma\\) threshold. For more information, see Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates.\n\n\n3.2.2 2. Outside of Home Range (OHR) suitabilities\nCCISS includes environmental suitability ratings for Douglas-fir and western larch in biogeoclimatic subzone-variants where there is strong evidence that they were suitable for the baseline 1961-1990 climate despite not occurring there naturally due to migration lag. Using the Model parameters dialog box, users can disable the inclusion of OHR suitabilities. See Documentation - Methods - OHR.\n\n\n3.2.3 3. Establishment suitability weights\nThe suitability report provides an assessment of establishment suitability, representing the likelihood of success in establishing the species to free growing if planted in the present climate. The default setting almost equally weights the environmental suitability (expert derived) in the baseline 1961-1990 climate, and the model predicted environmental suitability from the observed 2001-2020 climate, and the projected 2021-2040 climate, with a slight weighting towards the two most recent time periods. Using the Model parameters dialog box, users can manually adjust these default weightings to suit their needs. See Documentation - Methods - Rule Sets.\n\n\n3.2.4 4. Maturation suitability weights\nThe suitability report provides an assessment of maturation suitability: the suitability of the species through the entire future period to rotation (2021 to 2100). The default setting equally weights the four 20-year future time periods. Using the Model parameters dialog box, users can manually adjust these default weightings. See Documentation - Methods - Rule Sets.\n\n\n3.2.5 5. Global Climate Model (GCM) weights\nThere are 13 GCMs available in the CCISS tool. However, the CCISS tool defaults to the 8-model ensemble of GCMs recommended by Mahony et al. (2022)  and assigns each of these models equal weighting. The other five models were excluded because their warming rates are not supported by observational evidence (CanESM5, UKESM1, INM-CM5; explained here, because they only have a single run for each scenario (BCC-CSM2, INM-CM5), or because they exhibit unrealistic localized warming in BC (IPSL-CM6A). Using the Model parameters dialog box, users can adjust which GCMs are used and their respective weightings. See Documentation - Methods - Climate Change Projections.\n\n\n3.2.6 6. Scenario weights\nGlobal climate model projections follow scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The CCISS tool provides the option of giving different weights to the four major SSP scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Collectively, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 provide a reasonable representation of optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic outlooks on global emissions policies and socioeconomic development. The CCISS tool defaults to equal weighting of these three scenarios to represent scenario uncertainty in climate change projections. We have set SSP5-8.5 weighting to 0 in the default scenarios because it is extremely unlikely based on current trends in energy economics and policy (Hausfather and Peters 2020). Users can adjust these weightings using the Model parameters dialog box. See Documentation - Methods - Climate Change Projections.\n\n\n3.2.7 Example: ICHdw1\nIn this example, the user has manually selected five points of interest in the ICHdw1 BGC unit in the Slocan Valley using Option 1 outlined in Step 1 above. Using the default model parameters and default settings for reporting, the user will obtain a separate result for each of the five selected points.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: First panel of CCISS tool with five points selected in the ICHdw1 BGC unit.",

    "section": "3.3 SUITABILITY REPORT",
    "text": "3.3 SUITABILITY REPORT\nIn this second tab, users can access the main report of the CCISS tool. The default output is the Detailed report, which shows the distribution of suitability ratings for the global climate model (GCM) ensemble in each time period. The Summary provides a comparison of the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide (CFRG) species ecological suitability and the CCISS environmental suitability projections. Users can toggle back and forth between the Summary and Detailed version using the slider on the left-hand side of the screen, under Report Type (more detail below).\nThe concept and definitions of environmental suitability ratings and their relationship to stocking standards (according to the CFRG) and CCISS model projections are discussed in more detail in the Suitability Ratings section of the Methods documentation.\n\n3.3.1 Selection/Filter pane\nIn the left pane, users can select the point or BGC subzone-variant and then the site series of interest. The edatopic space of the selected site series is displayed in the graphic below for reference (see example in Figure 1 and 2 below). By default the report will show all species that are predicted to be suitable in at least one model and time period. Users have the option to choose the Suitable Only option to limit the list to species that meet the threshold for classification as suitable across the GCM ensemble in any of the time periods. Users can also opt to include outside home range (OHR) species here. For more information on OHR species, visit Documentation - Methods - Outside Home Range.\n\n\n3.3.2 Detailed report\nThe Detailed report shows modelled suitability ratios for each species in the selected site series for each time period. The colour legend for suitability ratings is on the left hand pane. The mapped BGC unit represents the historic climate approximated by the climatic conditions of the 1961-1990 period. The recent time period (2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed climate (measured by weather stations), and one for the climates simulated by the ensemble of GCMs. These two bars are not necessarily expected to agree: the modelled climates sample a large range of possible recent conditions, of which the observed recent climate is only one.\nThe report then summarizes the historical suitability ratings and CCISS projected suitability ratings for each species in the following order:\n\nThe CFRG suitability rating: Ecological suitability ratings for a timber objective taken from the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide for Stocking Standards (CFRG)\nThe CFRG P/A value: Preferred/Acceptable ratings taken directly from the CFRG\nThe Historical Environmental Suitability: Expert derived baseline (1961-1990) environmental suitability rating for site series.\nCCISS Establishment Suitability: The weighted average suitability rating based on the historical environmental suitability (1961-1990), and CCISS projected suitability based on recent observed (2001-2020), and 2021-2040 future projected climates. This indicates the likely level of constraints for successful establishment of the species in the present climate. Default model settings give roughly equal weight to the three time periods, with slightly more weight to the recent (2001+) periods.\nCCISS Maturation Suitability: The weighted average suitability rating projected across the four 20-year normal periods (2021-2100). This indicates the inferred suitability of successfully growing an established species to maturity (80 years). Default model settings equally weight all time periods.\nTrend: The proportion of the GCM simulations indicating improving/stable suitability (numerator) vs. declining suitability or remaining unsuitable.\n\nReminder: The weights used to calculate Establishment Suitability and Maturation Suitability can be modified using the “Adjust Parameters” dialog box in the “Select Sites” tab.\n\n3.3.2.1 Novel climates\nClimatic novelty refers to the difference between future climate condition and the climate condition of the closest biogeoclimatic analog. Where future climates are highly novel, i.e. there is substantial difference between the future climate condition and the closest analog, there is much higher uncertainty around species suitability projections. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5\\(\\sigma\\)) novelty are removed from CCISS results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed suitability results. Removal of novel climates can be disabled or adjusted using the “Adjust Parameters” dialog box in the “Select Sites” tab. If novel climates are not removed, the CCISS tool makes the assumption that all future analogs are equal, despite the novel climates potentially not being good analogs. See Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more details.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Summary report\nThis report compares CCISS projected suitability at maturity with the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide ecological suitability. Species codes are coloured according to trends in their future suitability using the legend at the bottom of the selection pane: improving (green), or decreasing (red). Species added to the CCISS projected stocking standard* are coloured purple, and species dropped from the CCISS projected stocking standard are strike-through.\n*Note: These are not formally adopted stocking standards by BC Ministry of Forests.\n\n\n3.3.4 Example: ICHdw1 cont.\nThe following example continues using the five points selected previously in the SELECT SITES Instructions panel of the CCISS tool. Figure 1 shows the top few lines of the Detailed report, when the default Remove highly novel climates is selected through the dialog box accessed via the Model Parameters button, while Figure 2 shows how this report changes when No Novelty Analysis is selected instead.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of a Detailed suitability report for the 101 - CwFd-Prince’s pine - Twinflower site series of the ICHdw1 biogeoclimatic subzone-variant in the Slocan Valley, with the option Remove highly novel climates selected in dialog box accessed through the Model parameters button.\n\n\nThe Detailed report (Figure 1) is displaying the results for the 1st point (1 / 6530760). The seven-digit number here simply refers to the hex cell that the point is located in. In this example, we have selected the ICHdw1/101 CwFd - Prince’s pine - Twinflower site series. We can see from the bars under Modelled Suitability that for Fd (Douglas-fir), the mapped (historic: 1961-1990) suitability was E1: High (Documentation - Methods - Suitability Ratings). Accordingly, the CFRG rates Fd 1 for Primary and P for Preferred at this site. The CCISS tool projections resulted in an E1 rating at Establishment, and an E2 (moderate) at Maturity. The modelled suitability ratios Trend shows that 87 percent of model “votes” suggested that the suitability of Fd would either improve or stay the same, and 13 percent suggested a decline in suitability.\nIf we return to the bar chart, under the “Mapped” bar, we see the two bars that represent the recent time period (2001-2020). From this, we can see that the weather station data (obs) and the climates simulated by the ensemble of GCMs (mod) are in agreement that Fd has been a highly suitable (E1) species at this location.\nThe CCISS tool then allows us to evaluate the future projected environmental suitability of the tree species. We see that in the first of the future periods (2021-2040), there is not much change in the suitability of Fd. However, in the next three future periods (2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100), we can see the introduction of novel climates. These are climates for which there is no good analog in the pool of Western North America historical climates. See Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more information. Since the climate in this region is projected to be distinct from other BGC analogs in Western North America, we do not know how well Douglas-fir will fare in these conditions, which means there is increased uncertainty around future suitability. Overall, the CCISS tool suggests that Fd will remain suitable to future climate at this location, with some caution around unknown suitability under novel future climate.\nThe next species on the list is Lw (western larch). The outlook for this species is more unfavourable than for Fd. As can be seen by the green E1 bar for “Mapped”, Lw was highly suitable under historical environmental conditions in this BGC unit, and rated primary (1) by the CFRG. However, the two bars for the recent period (2001-2020) demonstrate decreasing suitability to E2. CCISS projections suggest that as early as the current (2021-2040) time period, this suitability will drop to an E3. By the end of the century, only 17% of models suggest an E3 rating for this species, with 31% predicting unsuitable, and the rest falling into a novel climate where we do not know how Lw will respond. This information suggests that Lw is a highly risky species to plant in the ICHdw1/101.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example of a Detailed suitability report for the 101 - CwFd-Prince’s pine - Twinflower site series of the ICHdw1 biogeoclimatic subzone-variant in the Slocan Valley, with the option No Novelty Analysis selected in dialog box accessed through the Model parameters button.\n\n\nIn Figure 2, we see the impact that selecting “No Novelty Analysis” has on our results. In this scenario, the CCISS tool does not remove highly novel predictions, instead displaying all BGC projections including those that may not be good analogs. As a result, the CCISS gives us a more confident answer about the suitability of Fd, suggesting that its suitability until 2100 will remain fairly stable. In this example, the projected BGCs associated with novel climate contain an Fd species suitability rating of E1. Therefore, it promotes the Maturity Suitability to an E1, whereas in Figure 1, we see that it was demoted to an E2 due to the greater proportion of unsuitable (X) ratings in relation to suitable (E1) ratings. In Figure 2, the modelled suitability ratios show that 92 percent of model “votes” suggested that the suitability of Fd would either improve or stay the same, and 8 percent suggested a decline in suitability. Removing highly novel predictions represents a more conservative or cautious approach.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of a suitability Summary report for ICHdw1/101, which shows the difference between the CCISS projected environmental suitabilities and the original ecological suitability proposed by the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide.\n\n\nFinally, we see an example of a Summary report (Figure 3). This feature allows the user to explicitly compare CCISS results with those of the CFRG. The species shown in red text are decreasing in suitability. Those that are crossed out have, on average, across all time periods, GCMs, and SSPs, decreased so much that they are now predicted to be unsuitable. Species marked in green are improving in suitability, but none of those exist in the current example. Finally, if the user was to switch to No Novelty Analysis in the Select Sites tab, under Model Parameters, they would see some species show up here in purple (Adding). Purple species are those that were not included in the CFRG because they were historically unsuitable here, but CCISS predicts future climates in which they could be suitable.\nIn this case, we see that only two species remain suitable according to the CCISS projections Fd (E2) and Py (E3). Py (Ponderosa pine) is another interesting example, because the displayed projections (i.e. not novel climate) predict a divergence in suitability (E1, E3 and unsuitable), tending towards an increase in suitability over time and averaging to an E3 rating (Figure 4). This species has 80 percent of model “votes” suggesting increasing/maintained suitability, and only 20 percent suggest a decrease. However, much of the future climate is novel and there is a high degree of uncertainty around the future suitability of Py.\nNote on footnotes: Py has footnote 9 in the CFRG, which corresponds to most suitable on warm aspects. This is where applying expert knowledge to CCISS results is key, because under warmer future climate, it might actually be more suitable on cooler aspects instead.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Suitability report for Ponderosa pine (Py) in this example scenario for ICHdw1/101.\n\n\n\n3.3.4.0.1 References:\nChief Forester’s Reference Guide",

    "section": "3.4 BEC FUTURES:",
    "text": "3.4 BEC FUTURES:\nThis section summarizes the biogeoclimatic (BGC) projections that underlie the species suitability forecasts. Biogeoclimatic subzone/variants (a.k.a. BGC units) are the climate component of the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC). Each user-selected location has a mapped BGC unit representing its historical climate. Biogeoclimatic projections identify a BGC unit whose historical climate is the best match (best analog) for the future climate at a user-selected location. In other words, changes in climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc) are translated into a change in the BGC unit.\n\n3.4.1 Chart\nUsers can view the chart mode, which displays a stacked bar chart showing the ratio of future BGC analogs by time period predicted across a range of global climate model-scenario climate projections. Hovering over a stacked bar will display these proportions numerically.\nThe recent time period (2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed climate (measured by weather stations and interpolated across the province), and one for the modelled climates (simulated by global climate models). These two aren’t expected to agree: the modelled climates sample a large range of possible recent conditions, of which the observed recent climate is only one.\nThe default mode of this plot simply shows the BGC analog labels. Users can specify a site series of interest and select “Site Series Overlap” on the lefthand pane, which will display the site series in the BGC analog that overlap with the edatopic position of the historic site series, along with the proportion of the edatopic overlap. The “minimum site series overlap” slider allows the user to include or exclude site series with small edatopic overlaps.\n\n\n3.4.2 Map\nAfter switching to the Map tab in the drop-down menu under BEC Futures, users can select the site or area of interest from the drop down menu and then select a future time period. The map will highlight the historical BGC unit in colour (pink) and the projected BGC analogs in grey. Darker greys indicate a higher proportion of global climate model projections matched that BGC analog.\n\n\n3.4.3 Example: ICHdw1 cont.\nContinuing on with the example of the ICHdw1 - Interior Cedar-Hemlock - West Kootenay Dry Warm, in the Slocan Valley, we can see the projected BGC units that inform changes to species suitability (See Suitability Report tab), displayed as stacked bar charts by selecting Charts.\nNote: See Documentation - Definitions - BEC Codes for the biogeoclimatic zone and subzone names.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Stacked bar chart showing the mapped (historic) BGC unit, the BGC unit(s) associated with observed/modelled (2001-2020) climate, as well as the ratio of future BGC climate analogs predicted by CCISS. This version of the chart was created with the default setting for climate novelty in the Select Sites tab (Remove highly novel climates).\n\n\nWe can see that the future climate of the ICHdw1 in the Slocan Valley is predicted to much more closely resemble climates historically found in Washington, Oregon, and California. In the recent period’s modelled results, most ‘votes’ agree with the observed weather data that the climate most closely resembled that of ICHxw (Interior Cedar-Hemlock very dry warm) between 2001 and 2020. In the 2021-2040 time period, the IDFww (Interior Douglas-fir wet warm) becomes the dominant climate analog, and novel climates begin to appear. By the 2081-2100 period, the CMXxm_CA (Coastal Mixed Evergreen very dry mild California) becomes the BGC unit with the most votes. The historical analog for this climate is found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California (Figure 3), and it is much warmer than the historical climate in the Kootenays.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stacked bar chart showing the mapped (historic) BGC unit, the BGC unit(s) associated with observed/modelled (2001-2020) climate, as well as the ratio of future BGC climate analogs predicted by CCISS. This version of the chart was created by changing the setting for climate novelty in the Select Sites tab to No Novelty Analysis.\n\n\nWhen we ignore climate novelty and consider all analogs as equal, we see quite a different future, with a dominance of the CWFdm_OR (Coastal White Fir dry mild Oregon) in the 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100 periods.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Map highlighting the historical BGC unit - ICHdw1 - in pink, and the future BGC analogs in grey.\n\n\nFinally, in Figure 3, we see the location of the ICHdw1 in pink and the locations of the projected BGC analogs highlighted in grey.",

    "section": "3.7 CCISS SPATIAL",
    "text": "3.7 CCISS SPATIAL\nThe spatial module of the CCISS tool allows users to put CCISS results into spatial context and explore CCISS data inputs (i.e. BGC model and species environmental suitability ratings).\nFunctionality of the CCISS spatial module includes:\n\nMaps of biogeoclimatic projections for the GCM ensemble and for five representative GCM simulations;\nMaps of tree species environmental suitability projections for three site types (i.e., edatopes);\nOverlays of climatic novelty for each biogeoclimatic or suitability projection;\nPop-up interactive plots on user-selected locations ;\nInteractive plots of biogeoclimatic and suitability changes within user-selected subregions;\nDownloads of spatial data for active map layer at 200m raster resolution; and\nFind-A-BEC for locating specified biogeoclimatic units of Western North America.\n\n\n3.7.1 Subregion type\nThe options for Subregion type are None, District - BC Natural Resource Districts, and FLP Area - Forest Landscape Planning (FLP) areas. We currently provide functionality for 10 FLP areas; we will add more as they become publicly available. When a subregion is clicked on the map, an interactive plot appears to the right of the map. The plot shows ensemble mean change in biogeoclimatic unit area or species suitability; variation by GCM can be viewed by clicking the lines on the map.\n\n\n3.7.2 Display BGC or Suitability\nSelect whether the map displays biogeoclimatic (BGC) units or species suitability. Subsequent dialogue boxes are customized for each of these two modes, as described below.\n\n\n3.7.3 BGC mode\nSelect reference period (baseline) historical climate, observed recent climate (2001-2020), or future climates.\n\nWhen Reference (1961-1990) is selected, there is the option of selecting between Mapped or Predicted view. The Mapped BGC units are a rasterization of the official linework of BEC version 13. Modelled represents the BGC unit predicted by the biogeoclimatic model used to generate the CCISS projections. The model is trained with a sample of locations from each biogeoclimatic unit, and is not expected to perfectly reproduce the official linework.\nWhen Observed (2001-2020) is selected, this displays the BGC units selected by the BGC model associated with the observed (recorded) climate of 2001-2020. This time period already reflects a slight shift in the climate associated with each BGC relative to the 1961-1990 reference period and therefore the BGC climate analog selected by the model.\nWhen Future (GCMs) is selected, Select GCM controls whether the map shows ensemble results or individual GCM simulations. SZ_Ensemble displays the biogeoclimatic subzone/variant with the highest number of votes across the ensemble of 60 simulations (i.e., the ensemble vote winner); Zone_Ensemble shows the biogeoclimatic zone with the most votes. These may be different because votes for the highest-voted subzone variant may be outnumbered by votes for multiple subzone/variants from another biogeoclimatic zone. To see what the breakdown of votes was for any given location, users can click on the map, and a pop-up will appear with stacked bars showing the percent of votes for each BGC unit in each time period. For more information, see the example at the bottom of this page. Select period allows the user to select a time period between 2001 and 2100, split in 20-year increments. Here 2001-2020 represents the modeled results of the GCM simulations for that time period (not observed climate records).\n\nRegional summaries can be viewed by selecting District or FLP Area from the left-hand panel, and clicking on the area of interest on the map. A box will appear on the right-hand panel of the screen, where users can adjust the x-variable of interest (time, MAT - Mean Annual Temperature, MAP - Mean Annual Precipitation, CMD - Climatic Moisture Deficit , or DD5 - Growing Degree Days above 5°C). Users can also select whether they want to summarize by zone (or by subzone-variant if un-checked), and if they want to show the 2001-2020 observed period as points on the resulting plot.\n\n\n3.7.4 Suitability mode\nThroughout Suitability mode, there is the option of choosing a representative edatope (site type) and tree species.\n\nSelect Edatope (SNR/SMR) represents a Soil Nutrient Regime/Soil Moisture Regime combination. The dropdown provides the option of B2 (nutrient-poor, subxeric), C4 (nutrient-medium, mesic), or D6 (nutrient-rich, hygric). Displaying all 35 edatopes is computationally infeasible, so we chose these three edatopes to represent distinct, common site types.\n\nSelect species allows for selection among 15 common native BC tree species. Additional species will be added in the future. Codes for each species are defined in Documentation&gt;Definitions&gt;SpeciesCodes.\n\nThe mapping of suitability for each time period selected reflects the underlying BGC unit(s) mapped or projected.\nWhen Reference (1961-1990) is selected, this displayed the expert assigned suitability rating for site series that overlap the selected edatope. When Mapped is selected the mapping of BGC units reflects the BEC version 13 linework. When Modelled is selected the mapping reflects the BGC units predicted by the biogeoclimatic model used to generate the CCISS projections. The methods for assigning and definitions of these ratings are defined in Documentation&gt;Methods&gt;SuitabilityRatings.\nWhen Observed (2001-2020) or Future (GCMs) is selected, there is the option of mapping Projected Suitability or Suitability Change.\n\nProjected Suitability displays the CCISS environmental suitability rating for the selected time period associated with the projected BGC units.\nSuitability Change displays the change in suitability relative to the mapped reference period (1961-1990) suitability rating, increasing (blue), decreasing (red) or no change (grey). Species that are projected to become “newly suitable” in areas where they were historically unsuitable are mapped in yellow to differentiate this suitability range expansion from increases in suitability within the historically suitable range of the species (represented in blue).\n\n\n3.7.4.1 Suitability pop-up plot\nWhen a location on the suitability map is clicked, a pop-up is activated providing interactive 2D plots of the change in biogeoclimatic analogs and species suitability over time at that location. There may be more than one suitability rating for individual biogeoclimatic units because in some cases the selected edatope is shared by two site series with different suitability ratings (see Documentation&gt;Methods&gt;Edatopic Overlap).\n\n\n\n3.7.5 Display Novelty\nIn BGC or Suitability mode, the Display Novelty? checkbox overlays a map of estimated climatic novelty. High climatic novelty (&gt;5σ, red colors) indicates that the biogeoclimatic subzone/variant identified by the biogeoclimatic model is a very poor analog for the future climate condition, even though it is the best (i.e. closest in climatic space) available. The CCISS tool uses a default dissimilarity threshold of 5-sigma (5σ) to infer a novel climate and exclude the biogeoclimatic analog. Novelty in the 3-5σ range can be interpreted as a poor analog. In this range, species suitability inferences may be useful but are also likely to be somewhat misleading. The methods and interpretation of climatic novelty are explained in Documentation&gt;Methods&gt;Novel Climates.\n\n3.7.5.1 Novelty pop-up plot\nWhen a location on the novelty map is clicked, a pop-up is activated providing an interactive 3D plot comparing future climates to the historical climate of the analog. Click and drag to spin the plot. This plot is the same for all locations that have the same biogeoclimatic analog for the selected GCM and time period. Blue dots are the spatial variation in baseline (1961-1990) climates of the analog. Black dots are the 1951-1990 interannual climatic variability (ICV) of the BGC analog. Filled circles (grey-yellow-red) are projected climates of locations in British Columbia that are assigned the analog by the BGC model, with colours indicating sigma novelty consistent with the map legend. The cross symbol represents the ‘selected location’, the average climate of the projected future/observed time period selected for the location that has been clicked (i.e. individual raster cell). The axes of the plot are principal components (PCs) of analog variation, with PC1 being the axis with the most variation in the plotted points, and PC3 having the least. Labelled lines indicate correlations of the input variables with the 3 PCs that comprise the viewspace.\n\n\n\n3.7.6 Hide/Show Layer\nThis button removes the CCISS layer to reveal the basemap. This is useful for comparing the CCISS maps to the topography, satellite photo, or baseline BGC linework. These basemaps can be selected in the top right-hand corner of the map:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demonstration of how basemaps can be selected in CCISS spatial.\n\n\n\n\n3.7.7 Find-A-BEC\nThe Find-A-BEC feature helps with locating specified biogeoclimatic units of Western North America. Select the BGC zone of interest and then use Deselect All to select a subset of subzone/variants within that zone. Applying the Gray non-selected BGCs checkbox assists with finding the selected unit(s).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Demonstration of the Find-a-BEC function in CCISS spatial.\n\n\n\n\n3.7.8 Export data from CCISS Spatial:\nData from CCISS Spatial are downloadable as raster files. Users can opt to download data for the whole province by clicking on the gray Download Province button at the bottom of the left-hand panel, or they can select a specific district or FLP area in the same panel. If they select a district or FLP area of interest, a pop up appears on the right-hand side (also where users can view the regional summaries). Here, users can download the raster file of the map they are currently viewing.\n\n\n3.7.9 Example: ICHdw1 cont.\nThroughout the Instructions, we have been following an example of the ICHdw1 in the Slocan Valley of BC. Here, here we see the projected BGC analogs for this area. In Figure 3, we have selected to display BGCs, and are opting to look at the future. We selected the SZ_Ensemble, which represents the ensemble vote winner (i.e., BGC analog with the most votes) in the 2061-2080 time period. When we hover over the area represented by the black dot, we can see the Layer Info box that reads Predicted BGC: CWFdm_OR. When we click on this spot, the BGC Projections pop-up appears, which gives a breakdown of the different BGC units (i.e., subzone/variants) that were predicted by each of the model runs. We can see that indeed, in the 2061-2080 period, the CWFdm_OR - Coastal White Fir dry maritime Oregon - has the most votes, and that it received roughly 50% of votes for that period.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: BGC projections - SZ_Ensemble, which displays the biogeoclimatic subzone/variant with the highest number of votes across simulations. At the point of interest (black dot) added here, the ensemble vote winner (i.e., BGC unit with the most “votes”, is CWFdm_OR).\n\n\nNext, in Figure 4, we have selected Zone_Ensemble from the Select GCM dropdown menu. We can now see the predicted biogeoclimatic zone rather than subzone/variant. This zone is selected by adding up the votes for each zone. We can see that it is the CWF - Coastal White Fir - that has the most votes in the 2061-2080 time period.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: BGC projections - ZONE_Ensemble, which displays the biogeoclimatic zone with the highest number of votes across simulations. At the point of interest (black dot) added here, it is the CWF zone.\n\n\nWe can also look at tree species suitability over time, in three different edatopes. In Figure 5, we remain centered on the Slocan Valley of British Columbia. In this example, we have now selected to display Suitability rather than BGC. We selected the C4 edatope, and Fd (Douglas-fir). For a list of species codes, see Documentation&gt;Definitions&gt;Species Codes.\nIn this map, we are looking at projected suitabilities for the 2061-2080 time period. The green text represents areas with E1, or high suitability, while blue demonstrates areas with E2, or moderate suitability. The yellow areas have low suitability, and white areas are unsuitable for Fd.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Still centered around the Slocan Valley, this map shows projected future suitabilities for Fd (Douglas-fir) in the 2061-2080 future period. Green is E1: High, blue is E2: Moderate, yellow is E3: Low suitability, and white is unsuitable.\n\n\nWe can also look at suitability in a different way. Rather than viewing the suitability for a species in each time period separately, we can opt to look at the change in suitability over time (selecting Suitability Change). In this map, we see that the suitability ratings for Fd in the C4 edatope in the Slocan Valley are expected to decrease by the 2061-2080s. These areas of decrease are marked with a gradient of shades of red. Meanwhile, higher elevation areas upward from the valley are projected to increase in suitability. Areas where suitability is expected to increase are shown in blue. Finally, areas that are becoming newly suitable are shown in shades of yellow.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Map representing the change in suitability, as compared to the historic period (1961-1990) in the Slocan Valley area.\n\n\nIn this area, the CCISS tool predicts a lot of novel climates (i.e., climates with no good historical analogs). We can see that by clicking on the Display Novelty? checkbox at the bottom of the left-hand panel. This means that there is much uncertainty about how species will respond to changes in climate here, because there are no historical areas within Western North America that have experienced these exact climate conditions.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Degree of climate novelty. Red is very high novelty (&gt;5σ) and represents a very bad analog, yellow is high novelty (3-5σ) and represents a poor analog, and white represents areas without novel climates.",

    "text": "Step 1—Biogeoclimatic projections—Use a statistical model to assign climate analogs for a large ensemble of projected future climates for each location in British Columbia;\nStep 2—Cross-reference tree species suitability—For each site series at user-specified locations of interest, find the tree species environmental suitability ratings of the equivalent site series in the ensemble of climate analogs.\n\n\n4.1.1 Step 1: Biogeoclimatic projections\nCCISS uses spatial climatic analogs to make inferences about future tree species suitability. A spatial climate analog is a location with a historical climate that is similar to the current or future projected climate of a different location. Biogeoclimatic subzone/variants are a uniquely useful set of spatial climate analogs because they are familiar to resource management practitioners and are the organizing units for site-specific ecological interpretations accumulated over many decades.\nIn the CCISS framework, biogeoclimatic analogs are identified by training a statistical or machine learning model to recognize biogeoclimatic subzone-variants (i.e., BGC units) in terms of their historical (1961-1990) climatic conditions, and then applying that classification model to new (current or projected) climate conditions (MacKenzie and Mahony 2021). The new climates are thus labelled using their best analog within the BEC system, a process called biogeoclimatic projections (Figure 1).\nTo represent the uncertainty in modeling future climates, CCISS incorporates biogeoclimatic projections for 72 climate model simulations of the 21st century (8 climate models x 3 simulation runs x 3 socioeconomic scenarios).\n\nFigure 1: An example of biogeoclimatic projections for British Columbia, excerpted from Mackenzie & Mahony (2021) (a) is the biogeoclimatic mapping for BC; (b) and (c) are biogeoclimatic projections for recent observed climate and a global climate model projection for the 2041-2070 period.\n\n\n4.1.2 Step 2: Cross-reference tree species suitability\nStep 2 involves finding the tree species suitability information for the climate analogs identified by step 1. For each user-specified location at each 20-year period of the 21st century, the CCISS tool provides a historical biogeoclimatic unit and an ensemble of biogeoclimatic analogs. In the example provided in Figure 2, the historical climate is SBSmc2, and the climate analog for the projected future climate is IDFdk3. Both of these BGC units have associated site series, distributed across their unique edatopic grids. Each of these site series has associated tree species suitability ratings. The CCISS analysis adopts the suitability ratings of the biogeoclimatic analog as the projected suitability for that time period. In this example, on the 01 site series, spruce (Sx) and subalpine fir (Bl) are demoted while Douglas-fir (Fd) and trembling aspen (At) are promoted. Since there is an ensemble of 72 climate projections, the CCISS suitability projections at each time period are typically a distribution indicating the uncertainty in climate futures.\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the CCISS method of using climate analogs to project site-specific changes in tree species suitability, excerpted from Mackenzie & Mahony (2021). (b) An idealized slope profile illustrates that, within each biogeoclimatic subzone/variant (a climate type), the relative soil moisture and nutrients available for tree growth are moderated by site factors such as soil depth, soil parent materials, slope position and slope aspect. (a,c) Edatopic grids show the integrated effect of site factors on soil moisture regime (rows) and soil nutrient regime (columns). The cells of the edatopic grid are called edatopes. Three of the 40 possible edatopes are featured in this figure: the B2 edatope representing nutrient-poor and relatively dry (subxeric) sites; the C4 edatope representing nutrient-medium and moisture-average (mesic) sites; and the D6 edatope representing nutrient-rich and relatively moist (hygric) sites. Site series are groups of edatopes that can support the same mature plant communities. (a,b,c) Relative edatopic position does not change with changing climate, allowing equivalent site series and associated tree suitability ratings to be aligned between historical and projected climates. (d,e) Tree species environmental suitability ratings have been developed for all site series in each biogeoclimatic unit through expert knowledge. Equivalent relative edatopes support different tree species under different climate regimes.\n\n\n4.1.3 Further reading:\nThe other tabs in this section provide more detail on the methods underlying the CCISS tool:\n\nBEC—Basics of the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification and the draft classifications for the US and Alberta\nSuitability Ratings—Definitions of the tree species environmental suitability ratings.\nClimate Change Projections—Details on the ensemble of climate model projections.\nBGC Model—Explanation of biogeoclimatic projections and guidance on interpreting them.\nNovel Climates—Measuring how well biogeoclimatic analogs match current and future climates.\nEdatopic Overlap—Methods for aligning site series of the historical and analog BGC units.\nRule Sets—Rules for synthesizing the suitability projections into species-specific summary values for each site series.\nOHR suitabilities—Baseline suitability ratings for tree species outside their home range.\n\n\n4.1.3.0.1 References:\nMacKenzie, W.H. and C.R.

    "text": "4.2 Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC)\nIn British Columbia, tree species selection for reforestation has followed an ecological approach since the adoption of the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) by the provincial government in 1976. BEC is best described as an ecological classification framework that uses units of a plant community classification to identify and delineate ecologically equivalent climatic regions and site environmental conditions. The classification approach has hierarchical components describing climate and site level differences, each based on biological (vegetation) differentiation:\n\nBiogeoclimatic (BGC) units are a specific type of bioclimate unit where the units are defined and differentiated based on mature plant associations that occur on specific site conditions known as zonal sites. Zonal sites are those positions on the landscape which best reflect climatic conditions: neutral aspect, deep loamy soils, middle slope position, and mesic/medium edatopic position. Biogeoclimatic zones describe areas where zonal sites are dominated by specific late seral tree species (for forested units) reflecting broad climatic differences. Subzone/variants differentiate areas within zones by the late seral plant association of the zonal site. These more fine-grained units reflect variations in the regional climate and tree species composition of zones and define areas of ecologically equivalent climate space.\nThe site series describes the site-level ecological variability within each BGC subzone/variant. Predictably repeating patterns of site series occur on different site conditions as evidenced by changes in late seral plant community composition. Sites that support similar mature plant communities are considered ecologically equivalent and treated as members of the same site series. An independent set of observations of soils and site conditions are made during plot collection to determine relative position on two important site level environmental gradients for forested ecosystems: relative soil moisture regime (very xeric to subhydric) and soil nutrient regime (very poor to very rich). BEC organizes site series by position along these two relative gradients on an edatopic grid. This relative environmental position within a BGC unit allows the linkage of equivalent site concepts between BGC units in climate change modelling at a stand-level (i.e. a subxeric/poor site remains relatively subxeric and poor regardless of the over-arching climate regime).\n\nMore information on BEC can be found at BECweb.\n\n4.2.1 Composite BEC for western North America\nCreating species suitability projections for the future climates of British Columbia requires finding climate analogs in Alberta and the Western US. For Alberta, we adapted the Ecological Classification of Alberta (e.g., Archibald et al. 1996), with 21 natural subregions (Natural Regions Committee 2006) as the biogeoclimatic map units and 167 ecological sites as the site series units. For Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, northern California, and northwestern Wyoming, we use a draft biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification for the Western US developed by Del Meidinger and Will MacKenzie. The resulting composite BGC units are shown at the zone level in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Baseline biogeoclimatic units of British Columbia and adjacent jurisdictions, inferred from 20th-century ecosystem observations. Excerpted from Mackenzie & Mahony (2021). (a) Biogeoclimatic zones are the highest level of the biogeoclimatic classification. (b) Each zone comprises several subzones and subzone/variants. Draft biogeoclimatic ecosystem classifications for jurisdictions adjacent to British Columbia have recently been developed to support climate change adaptation with cross-border climate analogs. Zone names are provided in Table 1.\nTable 1: Names and codes of biogeoclimatic zones of western North America \n\n\n4.2.2 Data\nThe complete dataset of Western North America biogeoclimatic subzone/variants, associated site series information, and edatopic space can be found on the BC Data Catalogue. https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/cciss-western-north-america-bec-tables“target=\"_blank\"&gt;CCISS Western North America BEC Tables\n\n\n4.2.3 References\nArchibald, J.H., G.D.

    "section": "4.3 Environmental Suitability Ratings",
    "text": "4.3 Environmental Suitability Ratings\nCCISS incorporates historical (1961-1990) tree species environmental suitability ratings for all site series in British Columbia as determined by expert knowledge as data inputs. The primary criterion of this historical rating is an assessment of the probability of successful establishment and growth of a species across the entire environmental space of a site series, in the baseline (pre-climate change) climate normal period of 1961-90. These environmental suitability ratings conceptually represent a response curve of the species’ tolerances to environmental (climatic and edaphic) gradients (Fig 1). Site-level variation in species suitability within each biogeoclimatic unit for Alberta and the USA was similarly approximated using the plot data located in the modelled climate areas. More information is available in Archibald et al. (1996) and MacKenzie & Mahony (2021), describing forest associations or ecosites, and available autecological interpretations.\n\nFigure 1: Conceptual model of Environmental Suitability Ratings as a response to environmental gradients.\n\n4.3.1 Suitability Definitions\nWe define environmental suitability using five categories:\nE1 – High environmental suitability: Species well within its environmental tolerance range.\n\nWidespread establishment/regeneration success on all climate and edaphic conditions representative of the site series. Expect continuous distribution at a landscape or stand level.\nGood growth rate and form across the full range of site conditions.\nTypically, no geographic or environmental limitations within the site series.\nThe species is generally common and abundant in natural forests but may be of variable abundance where disturbance regime/stand age distribution is unfavorable (e.g., shade intolerant species in low disturbance landscapes).\n\nE2 – Moderate environmental suitability: Species occurring outside its core environmental tolerance range.\n\nThe species has variable abundance in natural forests and/or is often concentrated in select site types of the site series (e.g., warm aspects, higher elevations, elevated micro sites). Patchy or zoned distribution at a landscape and/or stand level are common.\nNot all site conditions of the site series may be suitable for successful establishment/regeneration. Species success is reduced when established in the open and species is fully exposed to climate conditions (e.g., Cw establishment in open conditions in drier ICH climate is limited by heat and sun exposure).\nSpecies may be more susceptible to occasional but expected climatic extremes leading to reduced growth, possible damaged form, or mortality (e.g. drought periods, snowpress, extreme temperatures, flooding).\nThe species may have good growth and survival where successfully established on suitable landscape positions or microsites. However, E2 rating may be used to reflect site series with broadly unsuitable site conditions across species (e.g., frost prone locations, or overly wet Spruce-horsetail site series).\nMay express slow growth rates or poor form across all site series conditions (e.g., site series within woodland subzones or xeric sites).\nGeographic, topographic, or other environmental limitations are common.\n\nE3 – Low environmental suitability: Species occurring near the limits of its climatic or site tolerance.\n\nSpecies is likely to be adjacent to climates or site conditions that do not support its growth and survival. The species is generally infrequent in natural forests and/or has significant environmental limitations in the site series.\nOnly specific landscape positions or microsites in a site series are likely to have establishment/regeneration success, but subsequent good growth is possible when these conditions are met.\nThe species may require canopy cover for establishment and growth. Sites that are fully exposed and open to ambient climate are unsuitable.\nE3 can be applied in BGCs with very limited growth potential (e.g., site series in parkland subzones) or that have harsh site conditions for trees (e.g., very xeric sites with shallow, discontinuous soils).\nClimatic extremes have a higher probability of causing reduced growth, damage, or mortality (e.g., drought periods, snow damage, and extreme temperatures).\nSpecies express very low growth rates across all conditions (e.g., site series in parkland subzones or treed rock outcrops).\nMultiple limiting environmental factors are common. Limited viability of the site series for forestry may support an E3 rating for all species in that site series.\n\nE4 – Minimal environmental suitability: Species at the very limit of its climatic or site tolerance. (NOT CURRENTLY INCORPORATED INTO CCISS PROJECTIONS)\n\nSpecies may occur sporadically but typically not forming any component of the forest canopy.\nScattered occurrence of individuals in natural stands but not reaching main canopy (e.g., Hw in the western SBSmc2).\nSpecies may have persistent cover but low survival and poor growth.\nSpecies assigned an E4 rating are not commercially viable due to poor survival and growth.\n\nE5 – Not Suitable: Species is outside of its environmental tolerance range.\n\nEnvironmental constraints preclude successful establishment, and species is not present in natural forests.\n\nE5 has been manually assigned only if the species was previously ranked as suitable for a site series in the CFRG and is reassessed as unsuitable. E5 rating is assumed where a species has no rating (i.e., is absent) for a given site series in the suitability tables.\n\n\nMore information on the development of the expert Environmental Suitability ratings and the complete dataset of historic suitability ratings for BC and Western North America can be found on the BC Data Catalogue BCDC.\n\n\n4.3.2 Suitability for different time periods\nGiven the progression of climate change, the above suitability definitions are incorporated into suitability rating assessments that account for different time periods in the CCISS tool:\nHistoric Suitability: The baseline environmental suitability rating based primarily on the expert suitability ratings of the historic period (1961-1990).\nEstablishment Suitability: The suitability rating based on the mean historic, current (2001-2020), and 2021-2040 future projected suitabilities. This indicates the likely level of constraints for successful establishment of the species now.\nMaturation Suitability: The mean suitability rating projected across the four 20-year normal periods (2021-2100). This indicates the inferred suitability of successfully growing an established species to maturity (80 years).\nFor additional information, see Instructions&gt; Suitability Report & Methods &gt;Rule Sets.\nOHR Suitability: Out of home range species -&gt; Off-site trials may indicate that a non-local species was suitable in the pre-climate change period but that migration lag or some other barrier restricted establishment. For further information see Methods &gt; Outside Home Range.\n\n\n4.3.3 Differences from the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide\nThe Establishment to Free Growing Guidebooks and Chief Forester’s Reference Guide for Stocking Standards (CFRG) rank ecologically acceptable species for each site series. Three criteria are used to determine the most suitable species choices for sawlog production (the assumed management goal) based on an assessment of:\n\nMaximum sustainable productivity\nCrop reliability\nSilvicultural suitability\n\nThe rankings applied always have at least one “primary” species for each site series indicating the best species choice to meet the timber objective.\nIn contrast, the CCISS tool assesses the environmental suitability rating to species, which focuses on how well the species is suited to the climatic and site conditions of a site series regardless of management objective. Each tree species has adapted to a specific range of environmental conditions, and its growth and behaviour depend on the ecosystem in which it grows. In an unfavourable environment, that species growth potential will not be realized, and its susceptibility to damaging agents will increase. Unlike the ratings applied in the CFRG, site series with generally challenging growing conditions may have no tree species assigned to the highest suitability rating.\nDISCLAIMER: Insect and disease risks need to be considered in reforestation, particularly in the context of climate change. These factors are currently being assessed by Forest Health researchers but are not directly incorporated into the historic ratings or CCISS environmental suitability projections.

    "section": "4.4 Climate Change Projections",
    "text": "4.4 Climate Change Projections\nThis section describes the rationale for the global climate model simulations used in CCISS and describes the small ensemble of five representative simulations used in the CCISS spatial module.\n\n4.4.1 The CCISS climate model ensemble for representing climate change uncertainty\nCCISS quantifies three types of climate change uncertainty: modeling uncertainty, natural variability, and socioeconomic uncertainty. These uncertainties are represented by calculating CCISS results for a large ensemble of potential future climate states. Rather than producing a single species suitability value, CCISS provides a distribution of 60 suitability values (8 climate models x 1-3 simulation runs x 3 socioeconomic scenarios) for each future time-period.\n\n4.4.1.1 Climate modeling uncertainty\nClimate models are simplifications of the earth system; they involve many compromises in modeling complex processes. Consequently, an ensemble of independent climate models is required to represent modeling uncertainties about climate change outcomes over large regions. CCISS uses an ensemble of 8 global climate models (GCMs), selected by Mahony et al. (2022), for independent modeling methods that are consistent with historical climate changes and the IPCC assessed range of very likely climate sensitivity: ACCESS-ESM1.5, CNRM-ESM2-1, EC-Earth3, GFDL-ESM4, GISS-E2-1-G, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1.2-HR, and MRI-ESM2.0. This ensemble is described and visualized in the cmip6-BC app.\n\n\n4.4.1.2 Natural variability\nGlobal climate models, and the Earth system itself, have internal variability—weather at time scales of hours to decades. At any point in time, the climatic conditions in different GCMs can differ not only because of differences in how they model climate, but also due to internal variability (weather). Even 20-year averages can differ significantly in different runs of the same model (Figure 1). For this reason, we include three independent simulation runs of each climate model in the CCISS ensemble.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Trajectories of simulated and observed climate change for southern Vancouver Island, illustrating uncertainty due to natural variability (weather) and structural differences among models. Small points are the changes in climate from 1961-1990 to 2001-2020 in up to ten independent simulations for each of eight global climate models (SSP2-4.5 scenario). Larger labelled points indicate the single-model ensemble mean change in 2001-2020. Lines indicate the trajectory of each single-model ensemble mean through 2100, with dots on each line indicating the ensemble mean during the five 20-year periods of the 21st century. The large grey square is the change in observed climate from 1961-1990 to 2001-2020 averaged across weather stations for the region. Trajectories further from the dotted grey lines (no change) indicate larger projected changes in summer precipitation (y-axis) and mean temperature (x-axis) or both. Model uncertainty is driven by differences in the global climate models (i.e., different colors) as well as differences in the individual runs of the same model (i.e., small circles of the same colour).\n\n\n\n\n4.4.1.3 Socioeconomic uncertainty\nThe third major category of climate change uncertainty relates to future concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere that result from global emissions policies and socioeconomic development. The climate model projections used by CCISS follow scenarios of future greenhouse gas concentrations commonly referred to as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). CCISS includes projections for three major SSP scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 (Figure 2). SSP1-2.6 assumes strong emissions reductions (mitigation) roughly consistent with the goal of the Paris Climate Accords to limit global warming to 2oC above pre-industrial temperatures. SSP2-4.5 assumes moderate mitigation and is roughly consistent with current emissions policies and economic trends. SSP3-7.0 is representative of a broader range of “baseline” scenarios that assume the absence of mitigation policies and is characterized by a linear increase in the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Collectively, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 provide a reasonable representation of optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic outlooks (respectively) on global GHG emissions reduction efforts (Hausfather and Peters 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Projected change in summer mean temperature for the Southern Interior Ecoprovince of BC, showing the ensemble mean and range of the 8-model climate ensemble for the three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios used as a default setting in the CCISS tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 The CCISS Small Ensemble of GCM runs\nIn the CCISS spatial module we provide biogeoclimatic projections for five GCM simulations that represent the diversity of patterns and trends in climate change across the full CCISS ensemble of 60 GCM simulations. This small ensemble of representative simulations was selected using the KKZ algorithm (Cannon 2015), which selects the model simulations that span as large of a range of climate changes as possible. We implemented this method using the mean of the changes in the biogeoclimatic model predictor variables from the 1961-1990 reference period to the 2081-2100 time period under the SSP2-4.5 scenario.\nThe five simulations provide a reasonable representation of the ensemble variation in temperature and precipitation changes (Figure 3). These simulations are not consistent in their position with respect to the rest of the ensemble; for example, the EC-Earth3 simulation has more warming than the ensemble mean in summer (Figure 3b) but less warming in winter (Figure 3c). Further, there is substantial spatial variation in precipitation change that can be obscured by the BC average (Figures 4 and 5). For example, the MPI-ESM1 simulation has very strong reductions in summer precipitation in southern BC that are balanced by increases in summer precipitation in Northern BC (Figure 4). For these reasons, it is not possible to characterize the simulations in simple contrasting extremes such as cooler/wetter vs. hotter/drier. Nevertheless, the five members of the small ensemble can be generically characterized as follows:\n\nMIROC6 r2—representative of the centroid (average) of the ensemble.\nMPI-ESM1-2-HR r1—least warming with regionally variable precipitation change (e.g., Figure 4).\nGISS-E2-1-G r2—low warming with large precipitation increase.\nEC-Earth3 r4—high warming with regionally variable precipitation change.\nACCESS-ESM1-5 r1—highest warming with strong summer drying in southern interior BC.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change in annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation of the small ensemble of GCM runs, relative to the full CCISS ensemble. Changes are from the 1961-1990 reference period to 2081-2100 under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and are averaged across British Columbia. (a) Change in mean annual temperature vs. annual precipitation. (b) Change in Summer mean daily maximum temperature vs. summer precipitation. (c) Change in winter mean daily minimum temperature vs. winter precipitation. Simulation names (e.g., r2i1p3f1) indicate the realization (run), initialization, physics scheme, and forcing scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Spatial pattern of changes in summer precipitation in the small ensemble of GCM runs, and of the full ensemble mean.

    "section": "4.5 Biogeoclimatic (BGC) modeling",
    "text": "4.5 Biogeoclimatic (BGC) modeling\nCCISS uses spatial climatic analogs to make inferences about future tree species suitability. A spatial climate analog is a location with a historical climate that is similar to the current or future projected climate of a different location. Biogeoclimatic subzone-variants (a.k.a., BGC units) are a uniquely useful set of spatial climate analogs because they are familiar to resource management practitioners and are the organizing units for site-specific ecological interpretations accumulated over many decades.\nIn the CCISS framework, biogeoclimatic analogs are identified by training a statistical or machine learning model to recognize biogeoclimatic subzone-variants in terms of their historical (1961-1990) climatic conditions, and then applying that classification model to new (current or projected) climate conditions. The new climates are thus labelled using their best analog within the BEC system, a process called biogeoclimatic projections.\n\n4.5.1 The CCISS BGC model\n\n4.5.1.1 Training point sampling scheme\nTo balance trade-offs between oversampling large BGC units and undersampling small BGC units, CCISS assigns training points to BGC units proportionally to the square root of the area of each BGC unit. This method ensures that smaller BGC units receive a relatively larger proportion of points compared to their total size, which prevents overly small units from being underrepresented in predictions. The number of points per BGC unit is then scaled by the interquartile range (IQR) of mean annual temperature (MAT), which results in BGC units with greater spatial climatic variation receiving more training points (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Diagnostic plots for the selected sampling scheme. Top panels show the number of possible points (i.e., pixels) by BGC subzone/variant, organized by smallest to largest BGC unit area on linear (top left) and logarithmic scale (top right), represented by the solid black line. The dashed line represents the number of training points (i.e., sample size). Labels on the x-axis are a subset of the 300+ BGC units represented in the plot. Bottom panels show sample size selected by each BGC unit area (bottom left) and based on the IQR of MAT (bottom right).\n\n\n4.5.1.2 Climate variable set\nAt the provincial scale, many variables effectively distinguish between coastal and interior climates, which is useful for broad-scale differentiation. However, these same variables can be less effective in distinguishing nearby BGC units from one another. Thus, to ensure that the retained variables were relevant for both local and regional differentiation, expert knowledge was combined with a local feature selection approach. Specifically, a set of ecologically relevant seasonal and annual climate variables was pre-selected, in addition to several derived variables. Any highly correlated variables were removed at this stage. A list was created, where each BGC unit was paired with all neighbouring BGC units. Separate Random Forest models were run, each with 101 trees, to determine the most important climate variables for each BGC unit, considering only that BGC unit and its neighbouring BGC units. These Random Forest models used the “Gini” split rule, and variable importance was calculated based on Gini impurity. Once a list of variable importance was created for each BGC unit, the most important variables were retained. Care was taken to include even those that may have only been important for a few select BGC units to retain the ability to differentiate between BGC units at a local scale.\nIn summary, the final expert variable set was chosen based on ecological relevance, low correlation, and high predictive importance within each BGC unit.\n\n\n4.5.1.3 Random forest model details\nTo classify BGC units, a Random Forest machine learning model was trained using the ‘ranger’ package in R (Wright and Ziegler 2017). This model was built using 500 decision trees, the extraTrees split rule, and a minimum node size of two, with training points selected according to the sampling scheme and climate variable set outlined above. This model underwent validation and comparison against alternative approaches, including multiple sensitivity analyses to assess robustness, accuracy, and sensitivity to training selection schemes and various model hyperparameters.\n\n\n\n4.5.2 Overview of BGC projection trends\nBiogeoclimatic projections are illustrated in Figure 2, excerpted from MacKenzie & Mahony (2021). While there is considerable variability in the pace and character of biogeoclimatic projections driven by different climate models, there are some common zone-level trends: the expansion of the IDF analogs northward into the current SBPS zone and into higher elevations in the current MS zone; the expansion of ICH analogs northward into the current SBS zone and into higher elevations in the current ESSF zone; the expansion of CWH analogs into higher elevations in the current MH zone and eastward into the current SBS zone; and the displacement of the current SWB zone by the ESSF analogs. Inter-model differences in precipitation changes are reflected in the biogeoclimatic projections, such as in the expansion of ICH analogs into the central interior in the wetter CanESM2 model instead of IDF analogs in the drier CESM1-CAM5 model. However, the tight relationship between warming and climatic displacement (Figure 1f) suggests that inter-model differences in the rate of displacement of historical climates are primarily driven by the amount and regional pattern of warming.\nThe biogeoclimatic projections for the 2011-2040 period include the incursion of exotic biogeoclimatic zone analogs into the province; e.g., the Sub-Boreal Aspen Parkland (SBAP) zone from Southeastern Alberta and the Interior Grand Fir (IGF) zone from Northwestern Oregon. In addition to these exotic biogeoclimatic zones, analogs for the projected future climates of BC also include exotic subzone/variants of familiar zones. The largest area of projected exotic subzone/variant analogs is in the boreal northeast of the province, where Albertan subzone/variants of the BWBS zone dominate. In later periods (2050s and 2080s), exotic analogs are also projected in the major valley systems of southern BC and on the south coast.\n\nFigure 2: An example of biogeoclimatic projections for British Columbia, excerpted from MacKenzie & Mahony (2021). (a) Mapped biogeoclimatic zones, which encompass the 211 biogeoclimatic subzone/variants used to model tree species suitability. (b) Biogeoclimatic projection of the recent period (1991-2018). (c-e) Biogeoclimatic projections of the 2041-2070 period (RCP4.5) for two GCMs with medium (CESM1-CAM5), low (MRI-CGCM3) and high (CanESM2) regional climate sensitivity. (f) Biogeoclimatic displacement relative to the change in the BC-mean temperature change for each of 90 model projections. Biogeoclimatic displacement is the proportion of grid cells across BC that have a different projected biogeoclimatic unit than their model-predicted biogeoclimatic unit of the 1961-1990 reference period. Boxplots show the full range and 25th-75th percentile range of the temperature change projected by the 15-GCM ensemble in each RCP/time period combination.\n\n\n4.5.3 Guidance for interpretation of biogeoclimatic projections\n\n4.5.3.1 Evaluating BGC Future Projections\nAn important consideration when evaluating the quality of any BGC future projection is that, ideally, it should be compared to the baseline of the same model, rather than to the original BEC linework. In some cases, the BEC linework and climate data informing the model might not align. A mismatch between the model and linework does not necessarily indicate an error. Discrepancies between BGC mapping and baseline BGC projections can, in some cases, indicate errors in the BGC mapping, and in others, errors in the baseline climate mapping, and should therefore be interpreted carefully on case-by-case basis rather than assumed to be inaccuracies.\n\n\n4.5.3.2 Interpreting Spatial Shifts in BGC Projections\nAlthough the visual effect of biogeoclimatic projections is of BGC zones and subzone/variants shifting across the map, these spatial shifts should not be taken literally. No analog is perfect, and projected analogs may be highly imperfect for several reasons. The actual future climate at any location will be a hybrid of (1) the characteristics of the analog climate, (2) novel climatic characteristics (e.g., extremes) that are not represented by the analog, and (3) enduring features of the local climate such as frost pooling, lake effects, and wind patterns. The estimated BGC classifications from any location and time period require careful consideration by the end users of CCISS products.\n\n\n4.5.3.3 BGC Mapping in a Changing Climate\nThe misinterpretation of biogeoclimatic projections as literal spatial shifts in BGC units has led to a common perception that climate change is rendering biogeoclimatic mapping obsolete. This is not the case. The linework of biogeoclimatic subzone/variants in many cases will remain useful as units of relative climatic variation across landscapes. The terminology we use for biogeoclimatic projections can help to emphasize that biogeoclimatic analogs are only approximations and that the biogeoclimatic units themselves are not undergoing spatial shifts. Rather than saying “this location is becoming IDFxh1”, it is more correct to say “the future climate at this location is predicted to be similar to the historical climate of the IDFxh1.” Rather than “the IDF is moving north into the SBS”, it is better to say “the SBS is transitioning into more IDF-like climates”.\n\n\n4.5.3.4 References:\nMacKenzie, W.

    "section": "4.6 Novel Climate Detection",
    "text": "4.6 Novel Climate Detection\nIn the CCISS framework, the pool of historical climate analogs consists of biogeoclimatic (BGC) subzone-variants from British Columbia, Alberta and the Western United States. For each projected future climate, the biogeoclimatic model chooses the most similar climate analog from this analog pool. However, the climates of Western North America do not necessarily represent all potential future climate conditions. There may be substantial differences between the future climate condition and the climate conditions of the biogeoclimatic analog. In such cases, the future conditions are a novel climate. The basic problem of novel climates (poor analogs) is that they give misleading results but are not explicitly identified by the biogeoclimatic model. Detecting novel climates requires an additional step in the CCISS analysis.\nCCISS measures climatic novelty relative to the climatic variation of the analog. In each biogeoclimatic projection, we calculate a novelty measurement for each BGC subzone/variant that is being used as an analog. We sample the baseline (1961-1990) climates found across the current geographical range of each BGC subzone/variant, and combine this spatial variation with the 1951-1990 temporal variation of the analog. This pooled spatiotemporal variation is then used to measure the difference between the climate of the analog and the future climates that are assigned that analog in the biogeoclimatic projection. To make this measurement, we use a metric called sigma dissimilarity (Mahony et al. 2017).\nNovelty detection for machine learning models is non-trivial and imprecise. The novelty metric provides an indication of where CCISS results may be unreliable or require additional expert input. However, it likely underestimates novelty in some locations and overestimates it in others. Users are encouraged to look at the broader pattern of novelty around their query locations to assess whether their local novelty results are representative. Over time, the CCISS team will develop region-specific interpretations of the drivers of climatic novelty and their ecological implications.\nThis article describes the CCISS novelty detection methods and results in a coastal case study and at the provincial scale. The goal of this article is to provide users with the ability to interpret novelty results with an understanding of the strengths and limitations of the method.\n\n4.6.1 Definitions\nThe following are definitions of key terms used in this article:\n\nBaseline — The historical climate used to compare observed climates of more recent periods or simulated future climates. The CCISS baseline period is 1961-1990.\nTarget — The current or future climate condition for which a historical analog is identified, and for which novelty is being measured. In CCISS, these are climatic averages over 20-year periods (2001-2020 through 2081-2100) for locations throughout BC.\nAnalog — The baseline climate condition assessed as being most similar to the target condition, among a set of candidate analogs. The analog pool for CCISS is the 1961-1990 climates of the biogeoclimatic subzone-variants of Western North America.\n\n\n\n4.6.2 The novelty metric – sigma dissimilarity\nThe basic question we are asking in novel climate detection is: “how similar is the future climate condition to the climatic conditions of the historical climate analog.” A statistical rephrasing of this question is: “what is the probability that the future climate condition was drawn from the same distribution as the climatic conditions of the historical analog?” Mahalanobis distances are commonly used to answer this type of question. Following Mahony et al. 2017, we translate Mahalanobis distances into a novelty metric called sigma dissimilarity.\n\n4.6.2.1 Mahalanobis distance\nThe typical understanding of distance is Euclidean distance, in which a line of equal distance from any point has the shape of a circle or sphere. The problem with Euclidean distance for novelty detection is that it doesn’t account for correlations among variables. If variables are correlated (as climate variables often are), the standardized Euclidean distance will overestimate the novelty of some points and underestimate the novelty of others. Mahalanobis distance overcomes this problem by accounting for correlations among variables (Figure 1). Instead of following concentric circles like Euclidian distances do, Mahalanobis distances follow ellipses with eccentricity that matches the correlation of the data. Assuming multivariate normality, Mahalanobis distances represent lines of equal probability that a new observation is an outlier. Mahalanobis distances are equivalent to standardized Euclidean distances in the principal components of the variables.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of novelty/outlier detection using Mahalanobis distance. Grey dots are individual years of 1951-1990 summer temperature and precipitation at Quesnel, BC. The climate variables are correlated such that there is a dominant mode of variability—cool/wet years vs. warm/dry years—that is detected by a principal components analysis (PCA) as PC1. The more unusual mode of variability (cool/dry vs. warm/wet years) is the second principal component, PC2. Mahalanobis distance is equivalent to Euclidean distance measured in the standardized principal components. The dashed ellipses are the Mahalanobis distances within which 95% and 99.7% of the years would be expected to occur, assuming multivariate normality of the data. A hypothetical new climate observation (black dot) is within the individual (univariate) distributions of historical temperature and precipitation, but it can be identified as an outlier (i.e., a novel climatic condition) because it falls outside their bivariate distribution as described by Mahalanobis distance.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2.2 Sigma dissimilarity\nMahalanobis distance is not in itself an adequate metric of novelty because the statistical meaning of distances depends on the number of dimensions in which the distances are measured. Since CCISS uses different numbers of principal components for different BGC analogs, these dimensionality effects are important. Thus to obtain an intuitive and statistically consistent novelty metric that can be used to compare across analogs, we use sigma dissimilarity (Mahony et al. 2017).\n\n4.6.2.2.1 Theory of sigma dissimilarity\nThe effect of dimensionality on the probabilities of distances can be visualized using a random sample from a multivariate normal distribution (Figure 2a). In any one dimension (either the x or y axis), there is a 68% probability that an observation will be within one standard deviation of the mean. In other words, 68% of the points are expected to have a distance from the mean of less than one. In two dimensions, the probability that an observation will fall within a distance of one from the centroid is reduced to 39%. As the number of dimensions increases, even more observations fall outside a distance of 1, such that all observations become increasingly distant from their own mean.\nThe probability of multivariate normal distances (and therefore Mahalanobis distances) are described by the chi distribution with degrees of freedom equaling the dimensionality of the data (Figure 2b-c). Chi percentiles can be expressed using the terminology of univariate z-scores; i.e., 1, 2, and 3 sigma (σ) for the 68th, 95th, and 99.7th normal percentiles, respectively. The chi distribution in 1 dimension is a half-normal distribution, and the sigma levels correspond to distance. This result is expected because Mahalanobis distances in one dimension are the absolute values of z-scores. At increasing dimensionality, the sigma levels shift away from the origin. For example, 1σ (the 68th percentile) occurs at Mahalanobis distances of 1.0 in one dimension versus 1.5 in two dimensions (Fig 2b, c). By extending sigma levels into multiple dimensions, sigma dissimilarity serves as a multivariate z-score.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. An illustration of the basis for sigma dissimilarity. a, Geometric illustration of the effect of dimensionality on the probability density of distances. b-c, Use of the chi distribution to describe Mahalanobis distances as sigma (σ) percentiles at increasing dimensionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Novel climate detection in CCISS\nTo measure climatic novelty with sigma dissimilarity, we need to define the variation that the Mahalanobis distance is proportioned to. The question we are asking is “novel relative to what?”\nSince CCISS uses biogeoclimatic (BGC) subzone-variants as climate analogs, it is primarily interested in whether the target (future) climate matches the baseline (historical) climate of any location within the analog. In other words, CCISS is most interested in measuring novelty relative to the spatial climatic variation of the analog. However, we have also found it necessary to include the interannual climatic variability (ICV) of the analog into the measurement (see rationale below). Therefore, we measure novelty relative to the spatiotemporal climatic variation of the analog. This is different from the approach of Mahony et al. (2017), who defined novelty relative to the interannual climatic variability of the target climate.\nNovel climates detection in CCISS is done separately for each BGC analog, in three steps:\n\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) – conduct a PCA on an equal sample of spatial variation in baseline and target climates of the analog, and choose a subset of the PCs that represent 95% of the variance in this pooled sample;\nz-standardization – standardize the retained PCs so that the pooled analog spatial climatic variation and ICV have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1; and\nMeasure sigma dissimilarity of target (future) climatic conditions. This approach measures dissimilarity from the target climate to the average climate of the BGC analog rather than to the most similar (potentially peripheral) location within the analog.\n\n\n\n4.6.4 Rationale\n\n4.6.4.1 In step 1, why is the PCA done on a combination of the baseline and target climates?\nMahalanobis distance can be unstable if all PCs are included. For this reason, we retain only 3-6 PCs that describe 95% of the variance in the data. However, there is no guarantee that the major principal components of the analog’s spatial climatic variation include the ways in which the future climate is different than the analog climate. In other words, distance measurement in the primary modes of spatial variation could be blind to the primary modes of climate change. This would cause underestimation of novelty. To ensure that the differences between the future climates and the analog climate are detected, we conduct the PCA on a combination of spatial variation in both the analog and target climates.\n\n\n4.6.4.2 In step 2, why are the PCs standardized to both spatial and temporal variation of the analog?\nScaling the novelty metric to spatial variation alone has two important shortcomings. First, very small BGC subzone/variants often have much less climatic variation relative to larger ones simply due to their size. This can lead to overestimation of climatic novelty for small subzone/variants. Second, spatial variation can be very low in the modes of climate change, especially for analogs that are located on flat terrain. Measuring climatic distances in PCs standardized to very low spatial variation can result in artificially high sigma dissimilarity. To make the novelty metric more robust, we include interannual climatic variability (ICV) in the z-standardization. Specifically, we pool the analog’s spatial climatic variation with the climate values of each year in the 1951-1990 period. A 40-year sample is used because it is more robust than 30 years. The ecological rationale for including ICV is that a future condition can be considered less novel if it is similar to individual years in the baseline climate instead of being entirely unprecedented. The effect of this modification is to reduce novelty in small and/or topographically simple BGC analogs.\n\n\n\n4.6.5 Variable selection\nNovelty should be measured in climate variables that are ecologically meaningful and relevant to the variables that were used to identify the climate analog. Superficially, it seems logical to measure novelty using the variables that were used to train the biogeoclimatic model. However, there are two reasons why the input variables to the BGC model are not necessarily the most appropriate for novelty measurement.\n\nMachine learning doesn’t use input variables equally for differentiating each potential analog from its neighbours. For example, the variable selection and thresholds used to differentiate grassland from forest climates are likely to be different from those used to differentiate subalpine from alpine climates. Mahalanobis distance, in contrast, is blind to the variables that differentiate the focal analog from its neighbours and instead emphasizes the modes of spatial and temporal variation of the analog itself. As a result, even if both the BGC model and the novelty detection were given the same input variables, their results would not necessarily be any more consistent than a novelty detection with different input variables.\nMahalanobis distance relies on the assumption of multivariate normality, i.e., that the analog variation can be approximated with a hyperellipse. While this assumption generally holds for temperature and log-transformed precipitation variables, it can be severely violated by the bioclimatic variables often used in biogeoclimatic modeling, such as degree-days and climatic moisture deficit. Violations of the multivariate normality assumption can cause large novelty artefacts.\n\nFor those reasons, CCISS novelty detection uses a basic 12-variable set of Tmin, Tmax, and precipitation of the four seasons.\n\n\n4.6.6 Threshold selection\nNovelty is a continuum. Further, the novelty measurement is prone to error because the relevant climate variables and ecological responses are unknown and specific to each ecosystem and tree species. Hence there is no objective basis for a threshold of sigma dissimilarity above which a target climate can be labelled as a novel climate. Nevertheless, it is necessary to establish a threshold of novelty above which BGC analogs will not be used to make inferences of future species suitability. If this threshold is set too high, CCISS will make invalid and misleading inferences. If the threshold is too low, useful information may be discarded.\nThe CCISS tool uses a default dissimilarity threshold of 5-sigma (5\\(\\sigma\\)) to infer a novel climate and discard the biogeoclimatic analog. 5\\(\\sigma\\) is a low bar to meet for analog goodness of fit. Assuming multivariate normality, it corresponds to a 1-in-3,500,000 chance that the target climate would occur within the analog’s geographical range and/or interannual climatic variability. However, given the many potential sources of error in the CCISS novelty measurement, 5\\(\\sigma\\) novelty could be more likely in some cases. This threshold provides a reasonable balance between the risks of making an invalid inference vs. discarding useful information.\nThe CCISS tool also indicates the proportion of each species suitability projection that is in the 3-5\\(\\sigma\\) range. 3\\(\\sigma\\) corresponds to a 1-in-370 event within the analogs spatiotemporal climatic variability. Novelty in the 3-5\\(\\sigma\\) range can be interpreted as a poor analog. In this range, species suitability inferences may be useful but are also likely to be somewhat misleading.\n\n\n4.6.7 Case study – CWHxm_WA\nTo illustrate the interpretation of climatic novelty in biogeoclimatic projections, we use the example of the CWHxm_WA subzone (Coastal Western Hemlock very dry maritime, Washington variant), which spans the Puget Lowlands in Washington State from the hilltops of the San Juan Islands to Portland, Oregon (Figure 3). The baseline 1961-1990 climate of the CWHxm_WA is widely used as an analog for current and future climates of the near-shore lands surrounding the Strait of Georgia including Greater Vancouver.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Location of the CWHxm_WA subzone in the Puget lowlands of Washington State. The CWHxm_WA is a common analog for novel near-future climates of the Georgia Basin, including Vancouver, BC. Areas of BC are mapped by degree of novelty for an EC-Earth3 SSP2-4.5 simulation for the 2041-2060 period. This image is a screenshot from the CCISS spatial module.\n\n\nThe variation of the baseline analog climates and the target climates are quantified in a PCA scree plot (Figure 4). The basic interpretation of the scree plot is that there are 12 PCs because there are 12 input variables each standardized to unit variance (st. dev. = 1). Since the PC was performed on the combined target and analog climates, PC1 is the primary mode of separation between the target and analog climates. PC2 contains the most spatial variation in the analog and target climates but very little separation of their means, as visualized in Figure 5b. Subsequent PCs contain decreasing spatial variation of analog and target climates, such that 95% of the variance in the pooled data is contained within the first four PCs. This was the criterion for exclusion of PCs 5-12. ICV variation does not decline as quickly because it was excluded from the PCA.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scree plot of the principal components analysis used in novelty detection for future climates (EC-Earth3, 2041-2060, SSP2-4.5) assigned to the CWHxm_WA analog. Circles represent the climatic variation in each PC of the analog climates (baseline climates of the CWHxm_WA), target climates (future climates assigned to the CWHxm_WA analog), and ICV (1951-1990 interannual climatic variability of the CWHxm_WA). Black triangles are the distance between the means of the target and analog climates. 4 PCs are retained for novelty detection based on the criterion of retaining 95% percent of the pooled target and analog variance.\n\n\nWhen viewed in the climate space of the first two PCs (Figure 5a), there is a clear separation in the baseline (1961-1990) climates of the CWHxm_WA (analog climates, blue dots) and the target (2041-2060) climatic conditions that are classified by the model as CWHxm_WA (red, orange, yellow dots). Degrees of novelty in the target climates range from 4σ (yellow)—suggesting that the analog is a poor match for the target climate—to 7σ (dark red)—suggesting that the analog is non-valid for these highly novel climates. The small overlap between the analog and target climates is an illusion of the 2-dimensional space of PC1 and PC2; when viewed in PC3 and PC4 (Figure 5c), the yellow target climates are non-overlapping with the analog climates, demonstrating that the 4th PC was required to detect the novelty in these climates. Since PC5 was excluded from the novelty measurement, the additional modes of novelty are not detected (Figure 5d).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Demonstration of novelty of future climates classified as the CWHxm_WA analog. Blue dots are the spatial variation in baseline (1961-1990) climates of the CWHxm_WA subzone. Black dots are the 1951-1990 interannual variability at a representative location in the CWHxm_WA. Filled circles are projected 2041-2060 climates of locations in British Columbia that are assigned the CWHxm_WA analog by the BGC model, with colours indicating sigma novelty consistent with the Figure 4 legend. Each panel provides a different orthogonal (perpendicular) view on the multidimensional data cloud, with PC1 being the axis with the most variation in the pooled points, and PC5 having the least.\n\n\nThe climatic novelty of the CWHxm_WA target climates can be further visualized in the context of the baseline climates of Western North America (Figure 6). These projected 2041-2060 climates (yellow to red points) have no overlap with the spatial climatic variation of Western North America. The CWHxm_WA (blue points) is the best (i.e., most similar) available analog for these future climatic conditions, but it is a poor analog at best (yellow points) and a non-analog at worst (black points). The primary mode of novelty is positively correlated with mean summer nighttime temperature (Tmin_sm), but is also somewhat correlated with spring and autumn Tmin. Since the mode of novelty is relatively uncorrelated with precipitation and daily maximum temperatures, the CWHxm_WA may be an informative analog for ecological drivers, such as drought, that are primarily dependent on these variables. This illustrates how a climate analog can be useful for some interpretations, but misleading for others.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: 3-dimensional view of the CWHxm_WA analog and target climate variation in context of other climates of Western North America. Symbology is consistent with Figure 5, with the addition of spatial variation (grey dots) and spatial means (multicolored dots) of the climates of other candidate BGC analogs. Labelled lines indicate correlations of the input variables with the 3 PCs that comprise the viewspace.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.8 Provincial-scale results\n\n4.6.8.1 Novelty over time\nFigure 7 shows the progression of climatic novelty over time in a global climate model simulation of 21st century climate change. Even in the baseline period (1961-1990), scattered locations have some degree of novelty from their model-predicted biogeoclimatic unit (Figure 7a). This baseline novelty can be due to (1) spatial climatic variation within a BGC that violates the assumption of multivariate normality (isn’t elliptical in shape) and (2) baseline model predictions that differ from the BEC mapping. Overall, however, there is a very low degree of novelty in the baseline period, as would be expected.\nNovelty in the simulated 2001-2020 climate is also generally low (Figure 7b), with notable novelty inferred only in small areas of the Peace region foothills of northeastern BC and the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park in northwestern BC. By midcentury (Figure 7c), there is widespread inference of moderate novelty (3-5σ; yellowish colours), indicating poor analogs in these areas. However, the majority of the province still has good analogs in this period (0-2σ; grey colours). By the end of the century (Figure 7d), moderately to highly novel (&gt;5σ) climates occupy most regions of the province. Highly novel climates are projected for northeastern BC, the coast, the Chilcotin Plateau and the southern interior.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Progression of climatic novelty over time. (a) Novelty of baseline observed climate. (b-d) Novelty of the EC-Earth3 simulation in three 20-year periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.9 Climate model variation\nThere is considerable variation among global climate models in the magnitude of climatic novelty (Figure 8). Some of this variation is due to different warming rates in the models, as indicated by the similarity in spatial patterns of novelty among models. However, there is also variation among models in the level of novelty at each warming level (Figure 9). For example, the MIROC6 model induces approximately half of the novelty as the GISS model at warming levels above 20B0C.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Variation in climatic novelty among individual simulations of global climate models, for the 2041-2060 period (SSP2-4.5 scenario).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Relationship of BC-mean novelty to warming level. Each point is one of five 20-year periods, 3 simulations, and 3 SSPs for each model, for a total of ~45 points per model.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.10 Sensitivity Analysis\nThis section provides sensitivity analyses demonstrating the effect of key methodological decisions, namely variable selection, PC truncation rules, and how to balance spatial and temporal variation (ICV) in the standardization. Unless otherwise stated, sensitivity analyses use the EC-Earth3 r4i1p1f1 SSP2-4.5 simulation at the 2041-2061 time period.\n\n4.6.10.1 Variable selection\nThe sensitivity of novelty to variable selection is illustrated in Figure 10. Both variable sets produce common regions of novelty, such as on the coast, southern Kootenays, and northeast BC, though the basic variables detect a lesser degree of novelty on the coast. The high-novelty region in the northern Columbia mountains in Figure 10b is likely an artefact of multivariate normality violation in degree-day and reference evaporation variables, which can have many zeros and highly skewed distributions. The disagreement between the two variable sets in the western Chilcotin is more enigmatic and deserves further investigation.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Sensitivity of climatic novelty to variable selection. Basic variables are Tmin, Tmax, and precipitation for the four seasons. BGC model variables are the 23 variables used to train the Random Forest model used to make the biogeoclimatic projections.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.10.2 Balance of spatial and temporal variation\nNovelty is highly sensitive to the relative weight of spatial and temporal variation. When interannual climatic variability (ICV) is excluded from the novelty measurement (Figure 11a), novelty is extreme in areas of interior BC with low topographic relief. This is primarily due to the modes of climate change being different from the few modes of spatial climatic variation on flat terrain. Conversely, when spatial climatic variation is excluded (Figure 11d), novelty is greater on the coast. This is due to lower interannual climatic variability in maritime climates and the prevalence of spatially large biogeoclimatic subzone/variants in the coastal classification. The contrasting drivers of coastal and interior novelty balance each other at intermediate ICV weights (Figure 11b-c). We chose an ICV weight of 0.5 for novelty detection in CCISS.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Sensitivity of climatic novelty to the balance of spatial vs. temporal (ICV) variation. ICV weight is the proportional influence of interannual climatic variability on the calculation of Mahalanobis distance, relative to spatial climatic variation.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.10.3 Dimensionality (PC truncation rule)\nThe CCISS novelty method retains PCs with a cumulative variance of 95% of the total data variance. Consequently, the dimensionality of the sigma dissimilarity differs among analogs, within the range of 4-6 PCs. Figure 12 illustrates the effect of dimensionality on novelty by measuring sigma dissimilarity at a uniform number of PCs throughout BC. In general, novelty increases when more PCs are retained because there are more modes of variation for future conditions to be different from their analog. However, the CCISS novelty method is not highly sensitive to the dimensionality of the measurement (Figure 12). This indicates that the results of novelty detection do not hinge on the decision to the 95% variance criterion vs. other potential truncation rules.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Sensitivity of climatic novelty to the number of principal components used to calculate Mahalanobis distance.\n\n\n\n4.6.10.3.1 References:\nMahony, C.R., A.J.

    "text": "4.7 Aligning Site Series (Edatopic Overlap)\n\n4.7.1 The edatopic grid\nIn the BEC system, variations in site conditions within each climate type (i.e., biogeoclimatic subzone/variant) are represented by an edatopic grid. An edatopic grid has 8 relative soil moisture regimes (SMRs) and 5 soil nutrient regimes (SNRs). Each cell in this grid, called an edatope, is the combination of one SMR and one SNR, and represents the finest scale of site differentiation in the BEC system. A site series is a group of edatopes over which a classified BEC Plant Association has been observed to occur. The distribution of site series across the edatopic grid is unique to each biogeoclimatic subzone/variant.\n\n\n4.7.2 Site series misalignment\nIn the CCISS analysis, the edatope of each location of interest remains constant as the climate changes. If species suitability ratings were specified for each edatope, and if the edatope of the location of interest were known, then there could be a direct transfer of species suitability from the future BGC analog to the location of interest. However, species suitability ratings are at the site series level, and typically the management decision is also being made at the site series level. This creates a problem for the CCISS analysis: since the edatopic distributions of corresponding site series at any edatope do not align among the BGC subzone/variants, there is ambiguity about which site series of the projected future BGC subzone/variant is the correct one to choose for any site series in the historical climate.\nThe problem of site series alignment is illustrated in Figure 1. In this example, the historical site series of interest is the 09 site series, which occupies four edatopes: D5, D6, E5, and E6 (left panel). The BGC subzone/variant analog for the future climate has three site series that overlap with this edatopic space: 07, 08, and 09 (right panel). Tree species suitability ratings from each of these three site series are applicable to the historical site series 09.\n\nFigure 1: Example of the misalignment of site series of a historical BGC subzone/variant (left) and the BGC subzone/variant analog for its projected future climate (right).\n\n\n4.7.3 Weighting site series contributions to CCISS suitability projections\nInstead of choosing a single “best match” analog site series, the CCISS tool uses all analog site series weighted by their overlaps with the historical site series (Figure 2). There are two directions of overlap: forward overlap (how much of the historical site series is covered by the analog site series), and reverse overlap (how much of the analog site series is covered by the historical site series). Overlaps are measured at the edatope level: partial occupancy of a site series in an edatope is counted as a full edatope. In the example from Figure 1, the historical 09 and analog 07 site series have a forward overlap of 25% and a reverse overlap of 50%. These overlaps are multiplied to produce an overlap agreement of 12.5%. After rescaling the overlap agreements by 1.273 so that they sum to 100%, the contribution of the 07 site series to the projected tree species suitability is 16%.\n\nFigure 2: Calculation of the overlap agreement for the example shown in Figure 1. Overlap agreement is weight of each site series to contribute its tree species suitability ratings to the CCISS projection for the historical site series of interest.\nExtra-edatopic site series (e.g. floodplains) are aligned to similar types by predefined rule sets (e.g., historical high-bench floodplain site series aligned to analog high-bench floodplain site series).",

    "section": "4.8 CCISS Rulesets",
    "text": "4.8 CCISS Rulesets\nTo account for uncertainty in future climates, CCISS uses a suite of 8 global climate models (GCMs) and 3 emissions scenarios (SSPs). This strategy usually leads to multiple projected biogeoclimatic subzone/variants (BGC units) for each requested location (as shown in the “BGC Futures” tab) and thus, a range of projected suitabilities. While it is often informative to observe the full distribution of projected suitabilities, CCISS also uses rulesets to “summarise” the projected suitabilities into a single value.\n\n4.8.1 CCISS Suitability\nFor each future period, the raw output of CCISS projections consists of possible suitability values (E1-high suitability, E2-moderate suitability, E3-low suitability, or X-not suitable) for each climate model/emissions scenario combination, i.e. a “vote” for a given suitability. (Note that due to overlapping edatopic space, there is often not a one-to-one match between models and suitability values. See the “Methods - Edatopic Overlap” tab for a detailed explanation of edatopic overlap.) To summarise these votes into a single “projected suitability” for each tree species at each requested location, we use the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Projected Suitability} = P(E1) + 2P(E2) + 3P(E3) + 5P(X)\n\\]\nwhere \\(P(s)\\) represents the proportion of votes for suitability \\(s\\) and \\(P(E1) + P(E2) +P(E3) + P(X) = 1\\). In essence, this is a weighted average of the suitability values, with slightly higher weight on non-suitable predictions. (Note that the E4 suitability class is not yet been incorporated into the CCISS model. For more information see “Methods - Suitability ratings”)\n\n\n4.8.2 Establishment and Maturity\nUsing the projected suitability described above, CCISS then further summarises these ratings over multiple time periods into an Establishment Suitability and a Maturity Suitability. Both of these are calculated as weighted averages of period-wise suitability: Establishment Suitability uses 1961-1990 (historic environmental suitability), 2001-2020, and 2021-2040 projected suitabilities, while Maturity Suitability uses all future periods (2021 - 2100). The weighting of the different periods are adjustable in “Model Parameters”, and are by default almost equally weighted.\nThere is one exception to the Establishment Suitability values: if a species is listed as historically unsuitable, but has a E1, E2 or E3 Maturity Suitability, it gets listed as a “Trial” in Establishment Suitability.\n\n\n4.8.3 Preferred/Acceptable\nIn order to align with the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide, CCISS also creates a projected Preferred/Acceptable rating, based on species-specific suitability cutoffs and the Maturity Suitability (described above). The CCISS tool uses these in the “Summary” suitability view, as well as in the exported data. For most conifer species, a suitability of E1 or E2 translates to \\(P\\) (preferred), and a suitability of E3 translates to \\(A\\) (acceptable). There are a few exceptions, such as Hm (mountain hemlock), which is only assigned \\(P\\) with a suitability of E1. With the exception of Oaks, most broadleaf species are not assigned a \\(P/A\\) value. This may be updated as additional information on broadleaf suitability becomes available.",

    "text": "4.9 OHR – “Outside Home Range” Suitabilities\nThe term “outside home range” (OHR) refers to tree species environmental suitability ratings that have been assigned in a geographical area (i.e. biogeoclimatic subzone-variant) where the species does not occur naturally. In some cases, OHR species were restricted by something other than climate, such as migration limitations (for example, western larch) or forest health factors (for example, Western white pine limited by blister rust). We have added an environmental suitability rating for OHR species for which there is strong evidence that they were well suited to the climatic regime of the historical reference period (1961-1990) that the species environmental suitability ratings are based on.\nStrong evidence includes species that have been capable of successful establishment, productivity, and resilience in an area for at least several decades as evidenced in long-term plantings of the species. In other words, the area lies within the species’ historic fundamental, but not realized, niche. These trees may not occur naturally in the area of interest (AOI) due to low migration rates, geographic isolation, or other non-climatic factors, but will likely be successful in this area immediately.\n\n4.9.1 OHR suitabilities included in CCISS\nCurrently, CCISS includes OHR occurrences of western larch (Lw), Douglas-fir (Fd), and Western white pine (Pw), supported by the following evidence:\nLw - Range modelling using historic climates strongly suggests the suitability of western larch beyond its historical range (Rehfeldt & Jaquish 2010).\n \nFigure 1. Range and environmental suitability of western larch in grey, historical range (left) and including OHR ratings (right) from the By-BEC tool. Darker colours represent higher suitability ratings in that BEC subzone-variant.\nFd - Successful operational and research off-site trials &gt;30 years of Douglas-fir in the AOI. E.g plantations in the ICHmc2 of the Skeena region. Extrapolated suitability into intermediate site or climatically similar areas. E.g. Douglas-fir added to SBSdk and ICHmc2 based on plantation evidence – extend into the ICHmc1 which is both a climatic and geographic intermediate between the two.\n \nFigure 2. Range and environmental suitability of Douglas-fir, historical range (left) and including OHR ratings (right) from the By-BEC tool. Brown represents coastal Douglas-fir, blue represents interior Douglas-fir, darker colours represent higher suitability ratings in that BEC subzone-variant.\nPw - Successful operational and research off-site trials &gt;30 years of Western white pine in the AOI. E.g plantations in the ICHmc2 of the Skeena region.\nNote: OHR suitability ratings are incomplete for Pw, resulting in a large distance between the historical range of Pw and OHR suitabilities currently included in CCISS. A fuller scale review and rating of OHR Pw (and other species) is currently in progress.\n \nFigure 3. Range and environmental suitability of Western white pine in grey, historical range (left) and including OHR ratings (right) from the By-BEC tool. Darker colours represent higher suitability ratings in that BEC subzone-variant.\n\n\n4.9.2 Caveats and considerations for application\nWe have included OHR species where reasonable evidence exists to harness the best available knowledge and more accurately capture the species’ fundamental climate niche. Species like western larch are being actively managed and planted outside of their historical range. Excluding OHR species would limit the effectiveness of the CCISS tool to inform current forest management practices.\nHowever, often suitability to the historical baseline climate (1961-1990) is not proven. Successful operational and research trials that extend well into the 1961-1990 period are less common. There are limitations to range models and there is uncertainty in suitability extrapolated into intermediate or climatically similar areas. We have included the option to remove OHR suitability ratings from CCISS projections as there is less certainty in the accuracy of these ratings. There is some hesitation around projecting off-site species into future climate given the already high levels of uncertainty in assisted migration. Users should interpret the results with caution and use other lines of evidence and local knowledge when making decisions.\nAs with all species planted in an assisted migration framework, risks associated with planting off-site tree species will also depend on climatic factors, including the (i) climatic distance between current and future climates in a region, (ii) uncertainty in projected future climates, and (iii) current climatic variability and extreme events beyond the tolerance of species.\n\n\n4.9.3 Functionality in the CCISS tool\nIf you click the “MODEL PARAMETERS” button on the home page, you have the option to toggle OHR species on or off. If OHR species is “on” future species environmental suitability will include projections based on OHR species ratings. If “remove OHR suitabilities” is selected future species suitability projections will not be based on suitability ratings outside of a species’ home range.\n \nFigure 4. Option to toggle OHR species on (left) or off (right) in the CCISS tool.\nYou can also toggle OHR “on” or “off” when viewing the Feasibility Report.\n\n4.9.3.1 References\nRehfeldt, Gerald & Jaquish, Barry.

    "text": "4.11 CCISS Expert Review\n\n4.11.1 As of April 2025\nGiven the complexity of forest ecosystems and climate change impacts on tree species, it is essential that the CCISS tool undergoes evaluation by experts. In 2024-25, the BC Ministry of Forest (FOR) Ecologists conducted a review of the following aspects of the CCISS tool (outlined below). We are currently engaging with additional subject matter experts to provide a review, including silviculturists, forest health specialists, and tree breeders.\n\n\n4.11.2 1. Tree Species Environmental Suitability Ratings\nThe initial environmental suitability ratings were assigned in 2017 by A. Banner (Coast and North Area), T. Braumandl (Kootenay-Boundary and Thompson-Okanagan), W. MacKenzie (Alberta), and D. Meidinger (USA). A subsequent review of this output in 2018-2019 led to some clarification of definitions and modifications of initial ratings, which were reviewed again by regional experts in 2021. In 2024/25, further discussions between CCISS team members and FOR Ecologists led to a review of and several modifications to suitability rating definitions. Using the updated documentation and rating process outlined above, the FOR Ecologists began reviewing species suitability ratings in their respective regions in February 2025. The objective of this latest review was to refine the suitability ratings using expert knowledge and other available information sources, to assist with filling in gaps, and to document known issues for further follow-up in the future. The resulting suitability ratings provide a strong scientific foundation and a consistent baseline for further refinement using quantitative methods. The FOR Ecologist review is complete for the Coast Area, Omenica, Cariboo, and Thompson-Okanagan regions as of March 2025, and in progress for the Kootenay Boundary, Skeena and Northeast regions as of April 2025. See Ratings of Tree Species Environmental Suitability (Collins et al. 2025), available from the BC Data Catalogue, for a full overview of the suitability process to date.\n\n\n4.11.3 2. Tree Species Environmental Suitability Definitions\nFOR Ecologists have provided feedback on the supporting documentation and definitions of Tree Species Environmental Suitability ratings. An in-person meeting with the FOR Ecology team to review CCISS model results and the historical species suitability ratings took place in November 2024. Per request of the Ecology team, the CCISS team developed new documentation outlining definitions and a multi-step rating process for species environmental suitability ratings, which we presented back to the Ecology team in December 2024. The CCISS team incorporated two rounds of revision to the Species Environmental Suitability ratings documentation resulting in a final version as of February 2025.\nSee the “Methods - Suitability Ratings” tab for more information.\n\n\n4.11.4 3. CCISS Tool Results\nFOR Ecologists are core subject matter experts for CCISS and we have engaged this group to perform an initial review of CCISS tool results. The Ecologist review will provide insight into the CCISS tool’s ecological accuracy and alignment with current ecological knowledge, help identify issues, and inform readiness for broader implementation. An in-person meeting with the Provincial Ecology team to review CCISS model results and the historical species suitability ratings took place in November 2024. All Ecology team members have used and interacted with the CCISS tool, documenting issues they identified with CCISS model results via Github issues. In addition to feedback provided through GitHub, we held individual meetings for each Forest Region to gather an initial round feedback in March 2025. This review is ongoing and iterative as we incorporate updates to the inputs (e.g., suitability ratings) and models (e.g., BGC model).\n\n\n4.11.5 4. CCISS Tool Layout and Documentation\nFOR Ecologists have also provided feedback on aspects of the layout of the CCISS tool, information presentation, and supporting documentation.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Issues requiring fixing\n\nThe CCISS tool should only take about 10 seconds to load at startup. However, it has recently been taking up to 50 seconds. We are investigating this issue.\nThe CCISS tool is currently missing CFRG species suitability ratings (“Suitability” tab) and silvics information (“Silvics” tab) for coastal subzone/variants, this is associated with updating to the new coastal BEC version (BEC13). We will update this information using a crosswalk table from BEC v12 coastal site series (LMH 26 and\n\nto BEC v13 (LHM77) asap.\n\nOHR (Outside Home Range) species suitability ratings for white pine (Pw) have been added in the Skeena Region. However, the CCISS tool does not include the full extent of white pine suitability outside of home range. Additional modeling and expert knowledge is needed to complete the distribution of white pine OHR suitability. This work is ongoing and will be documented and integrated into the CCISS tool. See “Methods” - “Outside Home Range” for more information.\nThere are known issues related to the classification and mapping of northern BGC units. This includes unclassified units, labeled “un”, for example SWBun or ESSFun. Additionally, some current BGC units may need to be split in the future. For example, the SBSwk1 has been mapped differently in the Omineca vs. Cariboo Regions. Douglas-fir is very rare in the Cariboo SBSwk1 but more common in the Omineca. SBSwk1 mapping will likely need substantial revisions in the Omineca.",

    "section": "5.2 Sources of error in data and analyses",
    "text": "5.2 Sources of error in data and analyses\nUnderstanding potential sources of error is essential for appropriate use of the CCISS tool. The CCISS methodology has many components such as the species suitability ratings, climate mapping, biogeoclimatic modeling, biogeoclimatic classification, and climate data downscaling. Each of these components have their own degree of error that can carry through into the CCISS tool results, emphasizing the importance of professional scrutiny in the interpretation of these results.\nWhile often used interchangeably, error and uncertainty are different processes. Error is the absolute difference between an estimated value and the ‘true’ value for a quantity of interest that, in most cases, is unknown. Thus, unlike uncertainty, error cannot be directly quantified. However, understanding potential sources of error can help users determine appropriate uses for CCISS projections.\n\n5.2.1 Suitability ratings\nTree species’ environmental tolerances are complex and many approximations are required to translate them into a simple suitability ratings metric used in CCISS. Suitability ratings for each tree species in each site series have been assigned primarily through expert judgement with support from vegetation plot data. There are inevitably errors in this database, particularly for species that were not historically prominent in reforestation, such as deciduous species. The suitability ratings are undergoing ongoing review by the CCISS team and regional ecologists. Further, the CCISS team is currently conducting predictive modeling to quantitatively evaluate and refine suitability ratings. For more information see Methods &gt; Expert Review\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of the By-BEC Portal, which facilitates expert review and revisions of the CCISS suitability ratings. This example shows suitability ratings for western redcedar on zonal sites, with editing for the CWHdm open.\n\n\n5.2.2 Climate mapping\nThe reference climate maps for CCISS are the PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) climate surfaces of temperature and precipitation at 800m spatial resolution developed by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium. These surfaces are best-in-class, but they have important limitations. They are interpolated from weather station data that is sparse in many regions of BC (Figure 2). Most valleys and some larger regions have no stations, so the nuances of climate in these locations may not be well represented, particularly cold air drainage and elevational gradients. Further, the PRISM method does not model microclimatic factors such as heat loading (warm vs. cold aspects), vegetation influences, and lake effects. Microclimatic factors need to be accounted for during professional interpretation of CCISS results.\n\nFigure 2: PRISM climate map of July daily maximum temperature, in the Cariboo-Chilcotin region. Stations are concentrated at low-elevations and are absent from large areas, demonstrating the potential for errors in the climate mapping.\n\n\n5.2.3 Biogeoclimatic (BGC) modeling\nBiogeoclimatic modeling involves using machine learning to classify climate conditions as biogeoclimatic units (subzones/variants). We have found that BGC projections are sensitive to many aspects of model training, especially climate variable selection. The current version of the BGC projections is a work in progress, and future refinements will be made. As more end users engage with the CCISS tool, additional issues may come to light.\nWe have already identified several areas for improvement. One key issue is that the baseline maps are not being perfectly reconstructed, resulting in fuzzy boundaries, and the over- and underrepresentation of certain BGC units. For example, the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine (CMA) zone in the Pemberton region appears to be consistently underrepresented.\nAdditionally, future projections appear highly sensitive to changes in sampling scheme, climate variable sets, and Random Forest model hyperparameters. These factors will be closely examined in future iterations to improve the model’s predictive ability. For more information, refer to the Biogeoclimatic Projections technical report.\n\n\n5.2.4 Climate data downscaling\nClimate changes are modeled in CCISS by overlaying very coarse-scale global climate model projections (50-150km resolution; Figure 3) onto the 800m PRISM climate maps, a method called change-factor downscaling. This approach results in a uniform warming rate from valley bottom to mountain top. In reality, we would expect elevation-dependent differences in warming rate due to loss of snowpack, for example. Similarly, change-factor downscaling can’t represent the role of other fine-scale features like lakes, vegetation, cold-air pooling, aspect, and soil moisture in modifying the regional average climate change. The Ministry of Forests’ ClimatEx project seeks to improve the spatial resolution of climate change modeling, but will not be integrated into CCISS for at least two years. CCISS users are encouraged to consider the role of site-specific modification of regional climate changes.\n\nFigure 3: Coarse resolution of climate changes provided by global climate model data. This panel shows the low-resolution interpolated changes in July mean temperature for the EC-Earth3 global climate model for the 2041-2060 time period, relative to the model’s 1961-1990 climate.

    "section": "5.3 BGC mapping as a baseline",
    "text": "5.3 BGC mapping as a baseline\nCCISS results assess change in species suitability relative to the official biogeoclimatic mapping, rather than the baseline prediction of the biogeoclimatic model. This approach breaks a standard practice of climate impacts modeling: change in a modeled quantity should be assessed against a modeled baseline. We have taken this approach to simplify interpretation of CCISS results. Our rationale is explained below.\nBiogeoclimatic models are trained on biogeoclimatic mapping (the response variable) and 1961-1990 climate normals (the predictor variables) for a sample of locations. When the model is then used to predict the biogeoclimatic unit from 1961-1990 climate normals, this is called a baseline prediction. Baseline predictions do not perfectly reproduce the original biogeoclimatic mapping because of imperfections in the biogeoclimatic model, biogeoclimatic mapping, and climate mapping. Biogeoclimatic models typically have baseline prediction error of ~20%, meaning that the baseline biogeoclimatic prediction is different than the official biogeoclimatic subzone/variant mapping on about 20% of the landscape. In many cases where these differences occur, the predicted unit is closely related to the mapped unit and there is negligible consequence for tree species suitability inferences.\nBaseline predictions are the technically correct point of comparison for biogeoclimatic projections of recent or future climates. If the mapped biogeoclimatic unit is used as a baseline, there is the potential to confuse model error with an actual change in climate. This conflation of model error with real changes causes overestimation of biogeoclimatic turn-over, but it can produce underestimation or overestimation of changes in species suitability. The impact of this conflation will be greatest in the recent period (2001-2020) since the magnitude of prediction error relative to climate change decreases over time.\nEven though a modeled baseline prediction is strictly more correct, we have chosen to use the official biogeoclimatic mapping as the baseline for CCISS results. The benefit of this approach is that the starting point for users will be the expected biogeoclimatic unit and species suitability ratings of their locations of interest. The alternative–using the modeled baseline prediction–would in some cases produce a baseline biogeoclimatic unit that is different than the biogeoclimatic unit of interest. This would not be tenable for core CCISS end uses such as silviculture prescriptions and stocking standards development.\nGiven that the mapped and predicted baseline biogeoclimatic unit are different on &lt;20% of most landscapes, and that these differences are inconsequential for species suitability interpretations in many cases, the practical impact of this approach is likely not large. Nevertheless, we have not yet assessed this issue quantitatively. Users are encouraged to use the CCISS spatial module to assess baseline prediction errors for locations of critical interest and to consider the implications for species suitability interpretations.",

    "text": "5.4 Space-for-time substitution\nThe CCISS analysis is a space-for-time substitution: it uses observations of tree species’ tolerances across spatial gradients in climate to infer each species’ response to future climate changes. In other words, to understand tree species suitability in a hotter future at any location, we study tree species suitability in warmer places (climate analogs downhill and to the south). The space-for-time substitution approach is useful and necessary; the alternative would be physiological modeling of each tree species, a process with its own assumptions, sources of error, and data limitations. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the space-for-time substitution approach. This approach assumes that spatial differences in environmental conditions mirror the temporal changes expected under climate change, with the added assumption that tree responses to these conditions are consistent across both space and time. The errors associated with violations of these assumptions will vary depending on the species, site, region and silvicultural system.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Other lines of evidence\nThe current CCISS analysis is a single modeling methodology with inherent assumptions and sources of error. Ideally, species selection decisions should be based on multiple lines of observational and modeling evidence. The CCISS team is collecting observational data and is planning to integrate CCISS analysis with other modeling approaches. In the interim, practitioners are encouraged to integrate the following information sources into their decisions:\n\nOff-site species performance trials\nForest Drought Assessment Tool\nClimate Based Seed Transfer\nProfessional experience\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Non-BEC factors\nCCISS adds a climate change dimension to the tree species interpretations of the BEC system. This approach accounts for many of the climatic and site factors in tree species selection. However, there are many non-BEC factors that are not directly accounted for in CCISS:\n\nInsects & disease—the role of forest health factors is explicitly excluded from the CCISS environmental suitability ratings, with the intention that they are a separate layer of information in reforestation decisions.\n\nSilvicultural systems—species suitability for reforestation is strongly affected by overstorey shade, site preparation, and microsite selection. In some cases, specialized silviculture practices will be required to establish trees on novel sites for which they are likely to be suitable in the future. Silviculture considerations are to some extent captured in CCISS implicitly or via footnotes. However, CCISS projections may in many cases be conservative because they do not account for the role of silviculture practices in compensating for climate and site constraints.\nMigration lag—the historical range of tree species in British Columbia in many cases may be smaller than their potential range due migration lag following the end of the last glaciation. Since CCISS suitability ratings are generally based on natural species ranges, migration lag is another reason why CCISS projections are likely to underestimate the assisted range expansion potential of some tree species.\nExtreme weather—the current CCISS methodology assumes that changes in the mean climate are representative of changes in the extremes (the stationarity assumption). This is a reasonable starting point, and a necessary one since incorporating climate extremes into the CCISS analysis is non-trivial. However, climate change clearly violates the stationarity assumption: the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome vividly illustrates that the distribution of extremes is changing across all regions. The change in extremes relative to the mean is another dimension of novelty in the climates of the future, and thus another way in which spatial climate analogs can under-represent climate changes. The extent to which the changes in extremes is significant for CCISS projections is undetermined, but deserves careful consideration during species selection.",

Differences between the ensemble mean projection and the observed climate are not necessarily a contradiction; like climate vs. weather, the ensemble mean is the expectation and the observed climate is what actually happened.\nHowever, if the observed climate is completely outside the range of the individual model runs, this is a problem. There are two major reasons why this could occur: (1) the downscaled model ensemble is failing to capture some aspect of regional climate dynamics; or (2) the observations themselves are biased due to errors in the station observations or in the gridded interpolation between stations.

    "text": "8.5 What do C4, B2 and D6 refer to in the CCISS Spatial Module? And why does SNR come first?\nThese are soil nutrient regime (SNR)/ soil moisture regime (SMR) edatopes, indicating poor/subxeric (B2), mesic/medium (C4) and rich/hygric (D6) site types across all BGCs. Providing spatial data for all 35 edatopes would be too computationally feasible, so we chose these three edatopes to represent distinct, common site types. Although it is typical to place SMR first in edatope names (e.g., 4C), we put SNR first because it is much more convenient in computer code.",

    "text": "8.6 What is the uncertainty around the current suitability ratings for the modeled US BEC units?\nThere is no equivalent, published biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification and mapping for forest ecosystems of the United States. In the CCISS tool, we use a draft classification of biogeoclimatic units for Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, northern California, and northwestern Wyoming to provide potential future climate analogues for British Columbia (details in MacKenzie & Meidinger 2024 - BC Data Catalogue). Site series classifications were developed, and species suitability ratings were assigned by an expert ecologist based on available plot data from the US and site visits.\nThere is a higher level of uncertainty associated with the US biogeoclimatic classification as the draft site series classification for US BGC units is more generic and broader (i.e. larger edatopic range) than BC, consequently there is less specificity on tree species suitability. Additionally, biogeoclimatic units are at the subzone level, and in some cases are climatically more diverse than BC units which are at the subzone-variant level. Finally, the species ratings have received less expert review and quantitative validation than those in BC, although they are expert derived and site visits have occurred.\nDespite these limitations, the inclusion of these draft US BGC units and associated environmental suitability ratings result in much reduced uncertainty in CCISS projections compared to their absence, as the analogs for future climate in much of southern BC are located across the border in the US. .",

    "text": "8.8 What is the difference between a projection and a prediction?\n“Projection”, “prediction”, and “forecast” are related terms with varying usage in ecology and climate science. For the purposes of CCISS we use the following definitions:\n\nForecast—A forecast is an estimate of possible future states of a variable of interest. A forecast is not a “crystal ball” of what will happen, but a quantification of uncertainty in what could happen. Providing forecasts of environmental suitability for tree species is the ultimate goal of CCISS. CCISS forecasts are a synthesis of many estimates of tree species suitability that have been carefully selected to provide a meaningful representation of uncertainty.\nProjection—A projection is an estimate of the change over time in a variable of interest given a specific set of assumptions. CCISS provides one projection of tree species suitability for each of three simulations of eight global climate models following three atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. The 2001-2020 period of these simulations is considered a projection even though it occurs in the past.\nPrediction—In CCISS, the term prediction is used exclusively as model prediction: the process by which a statistical model estimates a response variable (i.e., biogeoclimatic subzone/variant analog) based on predictor variables (i.e., climate variables). A model prediction can be made for any values of the predictor variables regardless of whether they represent past, future, or hypothetical conditions. Each biogeoclimatic projection for one 20-year time period is a model prediction.",

    "text": "8.11 What does “decrease of 1” in environmental suitability mean in practical terms? How we should I interpret this in situations like ops planning?\nA decrease of 1 means that suitability is expected to decline. For operational purposes, the actual change in rating is important. For example where a species is historically rated an E1 and drops to an E2 - this represents a species that was well within its environmental tolerance (high environmental suitability), which is projected to become moderately suitable - i.e. is outside of its core environmental tolerance range, may be more susceptible to climatic extremes and may have lower growth and survival, but is still suitable and could remain a good choice for planting depending on the specific values/goals for that stand. That would be quite different from a species that was an E3 - low environmental suitability - dropping to “unsuitable”, this would represent a species that was at the edge of its environmental suitability, will likely become unsuitable in the future, and would not be a good choice for planting.\nIt is important to emphasize that CCISS is a “tool” and should be used alongside local knowledge and within the context of desired values/goals to make reforestation decisions. So a decrease of 1, while at a broad scale means suitability is declining, could lead to different management decisions in practice.",

    "text": "8.12 Are the tree species environmental suitability ratings consistent across all species?\nRatings are applied consistently across species (See “Methods” – “Suitability Ratings”). While they are not perfect, they are expert derived and have gone through an expert review process to achieve a strong scientific foundation (See “Methods” – “Expert Review”). Quantitative validation of the environmental suitability ratings is currently underway (See “Resources”- “CCISS Technical Reports” - “Ratings of Tree Species Environmental Suitability”). Note that environmental suitability does not include forest health factors so those may vary from species to species even where the suitability rating is equivalent.",

    "section": "8.13 Do the environmental suitability ratings represent a linear scale?",
    "text": "8.13 Do the environmental suitability ratings represent a linear scale?\nSpecies environmental suitability is not rated on a strictly linear scale. See “Methods” – “Suitability Ratings” for the ratings definitions. Furthermore, increases or decreases in environmental suitability ratings do not necessarily scale linearly with changes in relative abundance for a species, but these metrics are generally positively correlated. Depending on the application it can be useful to look at trends in suitability change. For example, in CCISS Spatial we use the relative change in species suitability to demonstrate broad scale trends in a species across the province. See the CCISS Spatial tab on CCISS and choose “Suitability” - “Future (GCMs)” - “Suitability Change”.\nIn a case study on Douglas-fir, species environmental suitability ratings showed a positive relationship with relative abundance of the species in the BEC plot dataset. In other words, site series with higher environmental suitability ratings also had higher relative % cover of Douglas-fir. However, the strength of this positive relationship varied by biogeoclimatic zones, with higher agreement in zones where Doughlas-fir is a dominant species at the regional scale, (e.g. Interior Douglas-fir (IDF), Coastal Douglas-fir (CDF) zones) and less agreement in zones with more mixed species composition (e.g. Interior Coastal Hemlock (ICH), and Sub Boreal Spruce (SBS) zones). For more details see “Documents”- “CCISS Technical Reports” - “Ratings of Tree Species Environmental Suitability”).",
